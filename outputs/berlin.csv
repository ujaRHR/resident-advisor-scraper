At the psytrance festival in the Negev desert alone, roughly 400 young and innocent ravers, who just celebrated life, were brutally murdered. Many more were seriously injured. Hamas kidnapped 40 of them as hostages in the Gaza Strip. There were numerous testimonies of rape and sexual abuse, including gang rape.
One would think that public sympathy and solidarity with the victims would have been heard, especially from the club culture community, which has always prided itself on being ‘one family’, but the reactions were largely, as in the rest of the cultural and artistic landscape, deafening silence or even relativisation and justification of these obvious atrocities.
‘We will dance again’ wants to break this silence and send a strong signal of solidarity and against anti-Semitism, hatred of Israel and the glorification of terror. Because the attack by the Islamist Hamas on the Nova Festival was not just an attack on the visitors to a rave in Israel, but a fundamental attack on the basic values of club culture itself: Love, peace, freedom and unity

The event includes a day and night program with a film screening, panel discussion, reading, dance performance, information stands, Israeli food and a clubnight with DJs and live acts on three floors.

The proceeds will be donated to a foundation that supports the survivors and bereaved of the victims financially and in coping with their trauma.

In classic QS1 Fashion we have some new heads joining us, along with our long time friends and Residents. Almost to the day one year ago, we got the chance to host our first takeover in Renate, and it kicked off a whole series of events which we had never seen coming. Opening the doors to a Venue that fits thousands of people, felt truly nerve wracking, but exciting and like a step we wanted to take. 

This chapter to our Renate story will also be our last as a full full venue take over. These takeovers have given us the chance to invite friends to the stage and give the platform to people who we feel have really earned it. Thanks to all included once again for the unwavering support, assistance and love. You know who you are <3

Every shade and subgenre of electronic music has its place here, from fast, groovy techno to uplifting house music, from chugging EBM to frenetic breakbeat stompers.

Hailing from Sweden, Alexander Berg first made a splash a decade and a half ago first as half the duo Genius of Time, then as a solo artist under the name Dorisburg, pushing a precise, hypnotic tech-house sound. Now that he and his label Aniara came out of a four-year hibernation, he is as alert and present as ever – after recording the free-flowing ambient album That Who Remembers with Sebastian Mullaert for Spazio Disponibile, he's now back to releasing his sprawling, cavernous dancefloor grooves with glittering melodies. Dorisburg will be playing live in Säule for this edition of Klubnacht. On the Berghain floor, also presenting his music live is Portugal's Nørbak – after releases on Axis, Hayes and Mord, he linked up with Token this year for a strong 4-track EP, striking the perfect balance between rawness and technical depth and finesse. You can also look forward to a DJ set by Californian techno producer Developer, back at Berghain after a five-year hiatus.",Ostgut,https://www.berghain.berlin/de/event/77231/

This night is going to be special, filled with colorfully curated tunes, dancefloor liberation, and an incredible sense of community.

At House of Bade, we do not tolerate any form of discrimination—whether it's racism, sexism, queerphobia, or any toxic behavior. We’re dedicated to creating a safer space for all. If you feel uncomfortable or need help, our team and venue staff are always available.

More about the line-up:

The Berlin DJ and culture collective xcuse:u e.V. was founded in June 2022 by Ele, Kiki, Freya and Chiara with the help of a grant from Popkultur Lokal. The aim of the collective is to take progressive steps towards an inclusive club culture. With their events dedicated to the political aspects of club culture - such as representation, empowerment, safer spaces and raising awareness of discrimination - they want to create community spaces where people can inform themselves and raise awareness through workshops on (queer) feminist topics. xcuse:u wants to show that it is possible to make club nights safer, more non-discriminatory and more supportive. The representation of FLINTA* artists is clearly in the foreground - but the events are open to all supporters.



ayu bi always aims to abandon genres and borders, far away from a musical binary
they are weaving sounds from ear, to hips, to feet and through ur eyes - into a state of increased awareness for our surroundings, our fellow humans and the fibers of our interconnections.
music in its vibrant, lustrous diversity is meant to be celebrated.
life is too short for borders in the present,
let us tear down these limiting beliefs all together.
in ecstasy we free ourselves and on the dance floor,
we unite body, mind and collective purpose.


Sleeptwitch is one for the nerds: bringing the oldschool sounds to life with a focus on electro, detroit sounds and dreamy robotic music. This time they prepared a special mixture from acid house, to fun classics and everything in between.
Actively engaged in Berlin's music scene, she hosts two ongoing radio shows at Cashmere Radio and Systems Radio and is part of two collectives (@xcuseu.kollektiv @crush.kollektiv), organizing female and queer focused events, workshops, DJ sessions, and much more.

elliephunk is an avid SoundCloud surfer, old-time CD collector, and Berlin based, Taiwanese-American artist who has an unwavering passion for community building, and curating soundscapes that move the soul. Her sets are often lined with a groovy, punchy bass, and her body-moving selects generally pull from a housey mix of minimal bounce, handbag vocals, jazzy instrumentals, rhythmic beats, and UKG breaks... she’s also known for sprinkling in '80s soul, and nostalgic ’90s RnB/hip-hop samples for extra flavor.
Beyond the decks: As founder, catalyst, and “main mamacita” at casadephunk (a.k.a. casa), she’s taking an offbeat approach to event curation and shaping a new community around the concept “casa = house = home”. Bouncing between cozy, elevated in-house programs, and thoughtfully cute club nights, casa’s events bring together a diverse mix of artists from a wide range of disciplines: from visual to design, to fashion, to live music, to DJs and producers from various experience levels.

Vannessa Vegas, French born and Berlin-based, Sophie, aka Vanessa Vegas, has always had a deep connection to music. Her passion began on the dance floors, where countless hours spent immersing herself in the beats shaped her musical identity.
Having made her debut behind the decks during xcuse:u’s last DJ workshop, she brings a sweet tooth for 90s house, vocals, and high-energy grooves.

We're returning to Ohm with some old and new friends for a good ole' RS dance going all night long. 

We'll be joined by Amsterdam based DJ and producer Elias Mazian, a firm fixture of the club circuit in Amsterdam and beyond His DJ sets are never predictable, with house music forming a base to deviate from into all manner of unexpected sounds, be it jungle, techno or a classic pop song. The former Trouw and De School resident is refreshingly unafraid to share his sensitive side on the emotional journeys that form his dj sets, productions and radio shows. 

Also joining us is JADA a multidisciplinary artist known for her vibrant selection. Her characteristically joyful sets consist of catchy grooves and soulful nuances between house, breakbeat and bass music. Blending r&b, rap, baile funk and afro influences in-between she dives into the spectrum of sub-genres and conceptualises new soundscapes - the intersection of progressive dance music.

These two great DJ'S will be sandwiched between RS residents MLE and BZ who always put on a great show.

In Molly Nilsson’s words:

These songs were recorded during the first quarter of 2024 as part of the Villa Aurora residency program held at the former home of Lion and Marta Feuchtwanger (née Löffler) in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles.

Lion Feuchtwanger, born July 7, 1884, was a German Jewish novelist and playwright. Born into an affluent family – his father owned a margarine factory in Munich – Feuchtwanger was the oldest of nine siblings, two of whom also became authors. An early and outspoken opponent of the National Socialists, Feuchtwanger was among the first to be declared an official enemy of the state in Germany. His books were subsequently burnt, and his citizenship revoked.

In 1933, the now stateless Feuchtwanger sought safety in France. There, however, he would be imprisoned twice. First with the declaration of war in 1939, and again in 1940 after Hitler invaded France. With the SS drawing closer, Feuchtwanger managed to escape captivity following the intervention of, among others, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. A long-time reader who happened to recognise his face in a photo of work camp inmates, Roosevelt helped to facilitate his treacherous escape from Europe. Arriving in Portugal via Spain, he boarded a ship bound for America: the Excalibur. Travelling with a false passport under the name “Wetcheeks,” the literal English translation of his name, Feuchtwanger crossed the Atlantic. He arrived in America in 1941.

The Feuchtwangers eventually settled in the outskirts of Los Angeles, purchasing their home for $9,000, equivalent to the annual salary of a teacher at that time. From 1943, he continued to work and write alongside famous, LA-based exiles like Bertolt Brecht and Thomas Mann. Both were close friends and frequent house guests – though never both at the same time. He and his wife Marta established themselves in their villa, which became a meeting point, literary salon, and a bastion for anti-fascists and leftist intellectuals on the West Coast.

As World War II ended and the Cold War began, wartime allies became new enemies. In the McCarthy era “Red Scare” that ensued, suspicion of leftists turned into hatred. Thousands of real or suspected communists were persecuted in a series of public hearings held by the Committee of Un-American Activities. Many of those called as witnesses were humiliated, defamed, and blacklisted as a result. Countless lives and careers were destroyed by these hearings, and many suicides followed in their wake. Bertolt Brecht left America the day after taking the witness stand, never to return. Lion Feuchtwanger never had to face the committee, but his association with and open sympathy for the USSR prevented him from obtaining American citizenship, and thereby a passport with which to travel.

Lion Feuchtwanger died in 1956 after fifteen years in the USA. He was still stateless at the time of his death. Marta continued to live in the villa until her passing in 1986, leaving the estate and its immense library, which included more than 20,000 volumes, to USC. The property was eventually sold to the German state, which it now uses to host artist residencies, with several fellowships in various artistic fields provided each year.

This record commemorates the 140th birthday of Lion Feuchtwanger.

The match made in heaven is matching again. Pillow Princess and What a Playground are once again teaming up bringing all the housey sounds that keep us moving. Together, we’re crafting another 12+ hour journey of music, community, and love at Crack Bellmer including a lovely guest from Copenhagen, one of our Berlin favourites and three hours of open decks to support fresh talent. 

From the soft glow of the aperitif to the pulse of the dance floor, we’ll guide you from happy hour to after hour, with nothing but good vibes and a place for everybody. 

 

Like during our first edition we‘ll start early with three slots of open decks to provide space DJs to play first sets within a club setting. To apply for one of the slots please use the link in @pillow.princess.berlin & @what_a_playground bios and highlights.

At the door, we’ll be collecting donations to support @kop_berlin which stands for ""Kampagne für Opfer rassistisch motivierter Polizeigewalt”. This campaign works to support and advocate for individuals who have experienced racial profiling, discrimination, and violence at the hands of the police, raising awareness about systemic racism within law enforcement. Let's dance with purpose and come together to make a difference ♡

Pomelo Members Club
October 5, 2024 / 11PM-Late
@marmor_bar

DJs:

We are thrilled to have Dom Hyuga (@yami_club), one of Berlin’s hottest house DJs ( only god knows what’s in his small bag he’s always with ) spinning his signature beats. Known for headlining the capital’s best parties, Dom’s electrifying sets are guaranteed to keep you moving.

Love Leya, the rising star from Frankfurt, is taking the scene by storm. Since being booked by @keinemusikcrue for the exclusive Audemars Piguet event in Switzerland, her career is set to soar to new heights! See u soon Leya.

Will Tran, a Vietnamese-American artist who crafts sets that seamlessly merge cultural influences with pulsating beats. Recognizable by an iconic pink telephone, Will has graced the decks at Soho House Berlin and Georgia Bar, while also completing a two-month tour across Vietnam.

Rapha Garcés is an Ecuadorian DJ who now lives in Berlin. You can only love this positively crazy man.
He regularly enlivens the crowd with his Latin house mixed with minimal beats. He used to play at the best clubs. I don’t know what we love more his hair or his music.
We are very happy to have you with us Rapha.

C3MSTA started DJing less than a year ago and has managed to inspire people in Europe with his music in such a short time. Wait and see what the guy with the Colgate smile has prepared for you.

Location:

Marmor bar is located in the heart of Berlin’s electronic music scene. High class sound system meets aesthetic flair, good atmosphere and perfect drinks. What else do you need?

Please Note:

Due to the huge demand we had to turn away several hundred people at the last events. Please come early to increase your chances of getting in. Please don’t push at the door and take care of each other.

Even the organizers cannot place themselves above the security policy of the city of Berlin, please respect that.

Following Friday’s lineup of Svitlana Nianio, Romarna Campbell and Atsuko Hatano, it continues Saturday with a focus on Irish music. Traversing the nation’s diverse artistic landscape, we will present dreamy folk musician Anna Mieke, blues revivalist Muireann Bradley making her Berlin debut, electronic music newcomer producer Conor and Gash Collective founder and DJ ELLLL.

Originally from Wicklow, Ireland, Anna Mieke is a vocalist and multi-instrumentalist whose lyricism and enveloping compositions straddle the line between folk forms and vivid dreamscapes, drawing on traditional and contemporary motifs. The duality of reality and romanticism forms the thematic core of Theatre, her second album issued by Nettwerk in 2022 that “mines a rich seam of nostalgia and loss – and her extensive travels” as The Guardian summarised in their four-star review of the record.

Muireann Bradley is a 17-year-old fingerpicking guitarist and singer from County Donegal, Ireland, specialising in country, ragtime, and Piedmont blues from the 1920s and 1930s. During the 2020 lockdowns, she began uploading videos to YouTube and quickly gained attention with her rendition of Blind Blake’s “Police Dog Blues”, leading to an album offer from Tompkins Square. Her album I Kept These Old Blues was released in late 2023, featuring live studio recordings that echo the classic country blues artists of the early 20th century. The Irish Times gave the “impressive and hugely promising” debut four stars.

In his latest musical endeavour, Berlin-based Irish artist Conor is driven by an exploration of dancefloor sounds that juxtapose functionality and abstraction. From ambient and downtempo to industrial and glitch, his eclectic taste converges into a singular, forward-thinking sound that defies easy categorisation. With the premiere of his live set, Conor is also celebrating the upcoming release of his debut album on Digital in Berlin.

We are always happy to be back at the 120-year-old building of the Musikbrauerei in Prenzlauer Berg. Tucked away between Greifswalder Straße and Volkspark Friedrichshain, the former Schneider brewery is a rare building in former East Berlin for having survived, unspoiled, the creeping tide of gentrification. As we usually sell out, we recommend booking tickets in advance.",digitalinberlin,"https://www.digitalinberlin.de/tag/kiezsalon2024/, https://www.eventbrite.de/o/digital-in-berlin-17478803114"

Pretty Average strives to bring a fresh musical perspective to Berlin, that of a frontwoman who sets out to make a difference with her songwriting. Candy sings her songs in a gender-indistinct manner, backed by the distortion and the raw sound that Sergi has been developing since relocating to Berlin himself. They haven't stopped working on their music ever since. They intend to develop musically to help establish a musical counter-culture that resists today’s nihilism. A value that has been part of the band's identity since its beginning in late 2021.Last year Francisco Parisi produced the band for their latest release “All I wanted”, they published two editions of vinyl run, the first edition being sold out. Currently organising to keep working on singles with him until next year.

BED is a Berlin based band founded by Argentinian bass player Sol Astolfi and Chilean vocalist Nicolás Astorga in 2021. After initial experimentation and writing sessions, they invited German guitarist Ema Schiller to join. After the recording sessions for their first album, Turkish musician Eylul Deniz joined the ensemble. At its core, BED is a queer musical project, with a sound rooted in shoegaze, dream pop and post punk. Their lyrics are sad and sexual, weaving together threads of both vulnerability and desire, producing a body of work that challenges normative creative expression. This is exemplified in the vocalizations, which are intentionally gender ambiguous, representing a fluid identity throughout the album. Inspired by musicians such as Liz Harris (Grouper), Kevin Shields (My Bloody Valentine), Elizabeth Fraser (Cocteau Twins), Courtney Love (Hole) and Bowery Electric, the band winds together iconic elements of the 90s scene, layered with ambient and influenced by the Berlin rave scene. On the upcoming release, BED collaborated with electronic music producer Cybermission, who contributed drums and synth on the first single. EVERYTHING HURTS, the introductory track to the intimate glistening universe of BED is an angelic cry for help: a swan song to save a breaking relationship or to repair a broken heart.

Fluffy Maybes 松软许诺 is a kind of soft promise that may not be kept, a transcontinental musical experiment birthed in the pandemic. Finally meeting in person and under unexpected quarantine conditions, Jingyun and Robin recorded six hours of improvised sessions which eventually formed the single ‘Unnatural Disaster’ and the forthcoming EP. Moving through sounds of early electronica, sun-drenched psychedelia, and floating ambience, Fluffy Maybes 松软许诺 generate moments of spontaneous sonic playfulness, hypnotic pulses from other worlds and evolving waves of nature-inspired synthesis. Whatever happens in the future, at least for now we can shower you with some fluffy maybes.",fluffymaybes,https://www.facebook.com/events/419565144428361

As a sound artist, Margaux Gazur explores possibilities of sounds, using unconventional instruments, everyday objects and field recording to create a rich and textured soundscape.

There is a legend of a night between 1982 and 1987, at the Music Box in Chicago, when Ron Hardy left a mix running while the dance floor was still vibrating to the music. The booth seemed empty, but the music wouldn’t stop, creating a surreal and magical atmosphere. Attendees say that, although no one could see Ron Hardy, they felt his presence through the music, as if he was controlling the energy of the party in an almost mystical way.

We invite you to relive that experience. Feel free to explore the space, what do you hear? Feel the power of music propelling your body to explore by dancing. Imagine that you were there, that it is now, a temporary space that repeats itself while the experience is new and yet not. Those sounds are familiar, they are the legacy Ron left to our constant attempts to build community around the groove, and protest by dancing, because we exist and resist.

*Come and support with whatever you can this documentary about Ron Hardy’s life, because oral history is lost and we can’t afford it. #pleasedonate

Thanks to all the DJs who, with their music and love for House music, will help give Ronnie the place he deserves.

- - - - - 

From @OtherstotheFront we call on all creatures saved by the feeling of House music to donate and give support to @iwastheredoc - a documentary about the Life of Ron Hardy, which is also the history of House and at the same time our history.

Resident of the “Muzic Box” - an inclusive space where different realities converged: Black, Latinxs, LGBTQ+ people, and music lovers from various walks of life - Ron Hardy was always keeping this atmosphere alive, reflecting a club culture geared towards freedom, escape, and self-expression.

We always have loved that Hardy was not afraid to break the rules and experiment with new sounds. He understood the power of music as a force to bring people together, and his ability to mix genres and styles contributed to that diversity on the dance floor. Through his music, Hardy created an environment where social and cultural barriers dissolved on the dance floor.

Nothing would be the same without Hardy, this is why we are here talking about Ronnie now.

Let’s give him the place he deserves in (our) history. We owe it to Ron, and to future generations to keep his story alive. #pleasedonate make it happen! #savethedates

An Immersive Theatrical Experience Inspired by Octavia Butler's ""Parable of the Sower""

Berlin, Germany – August 6, 2024 – Little Woman, BIG HAIR Productions is thrilled to continue their collaboration with The Black Sex Worker Collective (BSWC) in the 2024 theme for the ongoing performance and storytelling series Heaux Tales with the latest socially engaged theatrical performance project theme: Black H'or Futurism. Part of the ongoing campaign for visibility, inclusion, the DEcriminalization of bodies and financial stability for The Black Sex Worker Collective - Berlin, this year’s theme is loosely inspired by Octavia Butler's speculative fiction novel ""Parable of the Sower."" 
Black H'or Futurism is a groundbreaking performance that delves into the sexual creative energies of Black Sex Workers in the fight for environmental justice, land rights, and labor rights with the backdrop of technology. In fragments, this production encourages the reimagining and reclamation of the displaced bodies and minds of those forced to the margins by social inequalities.
In over 24 hours of interdisciplinary and intersectional artistry, attendees enter the irresistible imagination of the central operating mind of a sleeping Black Sex Worker, portrayed by artist MF Akynos. Where in her dreamscape, a world unfolds fragmented dreams and false awakenings that explore the morbid realities, joy, and resilience within queer and migrant communities. Here, we find our roots in Afro futurism and African parables. Where our perception of darkness is challenged, the ancestors come to life, technology has greatly advanced, and onlookers access the transformative idea that sex work is part of our human future and that theories and practices of sex work developed by Sex Workers are essential in melding technologies, global Black experiences, and paths for radical tomorrows. 
Black H’or Futurism is profane, dirty, transgressive, posits future worlds built by and reflecting the experiences of people of African descent. Excerpts of the show will incorporate music, rest & rehabilitation and food. Commencing on October 6 through 7, the experience takes place at Berlin's own transformative artistic space, 90 Mil. A bevy of surprise guest artists will interpolate intersectional art within the conceptual dreamscape of creator and BSWC executive director, The Incredible, Edible, Akynos. Alongside original performances and stories by BSWC-Berlin members: Queenie Starr, Visage, and Angel Maxine. With guest performances by Liquid Brain Orchestra, Exocee, Savannah Morgan, Jade Lee, Michelle Tshibo, Mia on Acid, Edie Montana, and more!

Advanced ticket purchasing is highly encouraged. Those who cannot attend in person are welcomed to purchase tickets for communities who otherwise cannot afford to attend.

Curated and produced by the MaHalla team every first sunday of the month Sanctum of Sound will transform MaHalla for 12 hours from 12pm to 12am into a sacred space that is worshipping the creation and transmission of music and sound.

HANNES KRETZER
12PM – 2PM

Hannes Kretzer presents an immersive ambient sound experience, utilizing a quadrophonic setup to immerse the audience in spatial layers of textured sound. The performance will feature new material alongside previously released compositions, weaving together the resonant tones of the Cristal Baschet—an instrument known for its haunting, otherworldly resonance—and the deep, immersive vibrations of custom-built gong resonator speakers. This rich and dynamic sonic environment blurs the line between the organic and the electronic, guiding listeners into a reflective and meditative state.

TRILOKA
2PM – 4PM

TRILOKA offers an augmented sonic experience through the interaction of live acoustic and electronic instruments for meditative explorations, silent contemplation and the unfolding of the body-mind in the form of extended ambient sound journeys.The intercultural trio guides an immersive and introspective journey by combining the soothing melodies of the acoustic cello, the contemporary and psychedelic sound sculptures of the effected and processed electric guitar and the grounding frequencies of the gong and singing bowls.All of that while you comfortably sit or lay down, close your eyes, meditate, dream along or float away in the amazing space of MaHalla.

THE FOUR
4PM – 6PM

For each Sanctum of Sound, the music Ashram puts together a 4-piece formation of guest musicians and members of the Ashram.

RAZ O’HARA & LIHLA
6PM – 8PM

Rich and diverse in its sonic palette, Raz Ohara’s music shifts from soothing ambient textures, and harshly distorted synth peaks, to cinematic soundscapes interwoven with avant-garde contemporary classical and jazz music. His unique vocal style is imbued with a soulful and beautiful strangeness, an ability to convey deep lyrics of love, loss, introspection and exploration of emotional and spiritual themes.Classically trained cellist, composer and storyteller Lihla (Lih Qun Wong) combines a vast instrumental skillset of piano, cello, electronics and spoken word, to craft intensely immersive aural-hallucinatory worlds of intricately shifting landscapes. Classical instruments capture the meeting place between memory and longing, while explorational vocal and cello styles invoke and echo the ancient, the feminine, and the otherworldly.In their new collaboration, “An offering” dreamlike cinematic instrumental and electronic soundscapes take us through vast landscapes of reflection, dream state and memory. Storytelling and song guides us, as a link to our collective memory and a means to navigate inner landscapes. Setting the path for a poetic and deeply haunting journey through the internal psyche that is truly transportive and escapist.

ANDROMEDA MEGA EXPRESS ORCHESTRA
8PM – 10PM

A self-organized, independent group of likeminded individuals, AMEO is unlike any other orchestra: It’s a steadily working ensemble with a steady focus on experimentation. It is comprised of in-demand musicians hailing from various countries and musical backgrounds.  Daniel Glatzel, the orchestra’s leader and saxophonist is also its main composer and producer.Widely celebrated for its explosive, intense live shows – surprisingly accessible and infectious despite the musical complexity – AMEO’s concerts are essentially colorful sonic adventure trips that cannot possibly be repeated or foreseen.

PRIMEIRO
10PM – 12AM

Primeiro is an experimental electronic artist from Buenos Aires, Argentina. His music transcends conventional boundaries, delving into the realms of ambient, hand-made trance, and techno. While his work may initially evoke a sense of tranquility akin to artists like Hiroshi Yoshimura, a closer examination reveals intricate layers and meticulous arpegios.In 2023, he released his first album, “Music for Horses,” with the Berlin-based label Danzee. He organizes the Feed the River festival, expressing that rivers are living beings and like all beings they need to be nourished, inspired by the concept of Animism and the use of sound to foster meaningful transformative dialogues.As part of the group Lujo Asiático, he has released three vinyl albums then touring in Europe and Japan.

At the same time, all socialist governments in Central and Eastern Europe fell; there was initially a spirit of optimism and hope for more freedom and democracy. Techno in particular became the soundtrack to political and social change. As a contribution to the Day of Club Culture 2024, Soundwatch presents films and sounds from the early post-socialist party scene and reflects on their echoes today.

German premiere

Rave OmeU
PL 2024 76 min Directors: Łukasz Ronduda, Dawid Nickel
With little-seen archive footage of parties and art happenings, the film tells the story of the development of rave music and subculture in Poland. Two young ravers guide us through this world: Marysia and Janusz, as well as Marcello Zamenhoff - a performance artist and one of the pioneers of Polish rave. A fundamental question for the protagonists is how the young generation can overcome the classism in the Polish techno scene, which has been pronounced since its beginnings in the 90s.

ŁUKASZ RONDUDA is a feature film director and curator at the Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw. His films explore unusual forms of representing art and artistic processes. His debut PERFORMER won the “Think:Film Award” at the Berlin International Film Festival. His second film, A HEART OF LOVE, was presented at several international film festivals, including Berlin and Rotterdam. RAVE builds upon the exhibition “140 Beats per Minute” which he curated about techno culture and art in Poland in the 1990s.

DAWID NICKEL focuses on telling the stories of people who are perceived stereotypically because of their sexual orientation or social status. His first feature film LOVE TASTING was awarded the main prize in the micro-budget section at the Polish Film Festival. In 2023, his latest productions premiered: FILIPKA, a short documentary about his queer and gender-fluid friend, and the high-end TV series for HBO Max, #BRING BACK ALICE.

Followed by Club Sounds East lounge in the lobby and videos in the cinema.

Die Münchner Musiker brausen durch Indie, Jazz und Psychedelic Rock, stets in bewusster Zurückhaltung, um live nochmal einen Gang höher schalten zu können.
Die Besetzung der Band mit zwei Schlagzeugen, vom englischen Mojo Magazin als “gut geölte Maschine” bezeichnet, wurde im Studio mit Posaunen, Akustikgitarren und diversen Percussions frisiert. Dabei geht es der Band immer um das Spiel mit Erwartungen, egal ob mit diesen gebrochen wird oder ob sie erfüllt werden. So werden die melancholisch-eingängigen Melodien weiterhin von Trompete und Gitarre getragen, während die Drum Grooves auf dem neuen Album mehr einem Rock Jargon entlehnt sind.

Im Oktober gehen Fazer in Deutschland auf Tour.

Für diese Veranstaltung bieten wir ermäßigte Tickets an, um auch Menschen mit kleinerem Portmonee Zugang zu Kultur zu ermöglichen. Diese Kontingente sind limitiert und nur bei TixforGigs verfügbar. Wir vertrauen auf Eure Selbsteinschätzung: Wenn ihr könnt, bucht Standard-Tickets und überlasst die ermäßigten Kontingente denjenigen, die gerade sehr sparen müssen.

We are pleased to announce a new edition of our Immersive Sensory Experience ""Natural"", next Tuesday 08. October at the same time, 7:00 PM CET.

The results from last weeks events in the larger space has been marvellous, so we'll continue doing it in there until a big step is announced.

Regarding the artist, Saumet, a Berlin-based multidisciplinary artist, will perform a 120-minute hybrid set inspired by the dynamics of real life, the synergy of their recent travels, and their current soundscapes. Their live compositions are always a fresh surprise influenced by the audience.""

Saumeth narrates subtly the interaction between individuals, their immediate environment and soundscapes as a full composition part of the intrinsic ""real-time"" synergy of expression that reflects the individual as collective understanding.

The sound design is interpreted uniquely each time, as an expression of human improvisation affected by the audience, i.e. it syntactically reads the development of social behaviours and surrounding understandings where forms and architecture are central to their connection.
Saumet creates a room for the connection of individuals, crafting an atmosphere for emotional extension and mental relaxation that open channels to meditate. Visuals invite attendees explore their minds as they immerse themselves in an illusory space of audiovisual intrinsic imagery, creating room to express their immediate thoughts and sensations through glow-in-the-dark colours.

About the artist:

Saumet has been featured by different electronic music makers and record labels, as well as performed in Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Belgrade and Berlin to name some.

He creates an environment for meditation and relaxation. You can come to explore their sound through sound design and visuals, as well as to relax yourself or even paint.

Please arrive 15 minutes before 7pm to assure your place.
7pm | 7€ (donation for the house) or 10€ incl. a drink.

Limited spots.

Deutsch:

Wir freuen uns, eine neue Ausgabe unserer Immersive Sensory Experience „Natural“ ankündigen zu können, die am Dienstag, den 08. Oktober zur gleichen Zeit, 19Uhr MEZ.

Die Ergebnisse der Veranstaltungen der letzten Wochen in dem größeren Raum waren großartig, also werden wir dort weitermachen, bis ein großer Schritt angekündigt wird.

Saumet, ein Berliner Künstler, der mit verschiedenen Medien arbeitet, wird ein 120-minütiges Set spielen, das eine Mischung aus verschiedenen Stilen ist. Es ist inspiriert vom echten Leben, seinen letzten Reisen und den Klängen, die er gerade hört. Seine Live-Sets sind immer eine Überraschung, beeinflusst vom Publikum.

Saumet erzählt eine Geschichte darüber, wie Menschen miteinander interagieren, ihre Umgebung und die Geräusche um sie herum. Das alles ist Teil der 'Real-Time'-Erfahrung des gemeinsamen Ausdrucks.

Das Sounddesign ist immer anders, je nach Publikum. Es ist wie eine menschliche Improvisation, die auf die Menschen um sie herum reagiert. Die Art und Weise, wie Menschen sich verhalten und verstehen, beeinflusst die Musik. Die Formen und Strukturen des Raums sind auch wichtig.

Saumet schafft einen Raum für Menschen, um sich zu verbinden. Er schafft eine Atmosphäre, in der man seine Gefühle spüren und entspannen kann. Das hilft dir zu meditieren. Die Visuals laden dich ein, deinen Geist zu erkunden, während du dich in der Welt der Bilder verlierst. Du kannst deine Gedanken und Gefühle mit den leuchtenden Farben ausdrücken.

Über den Künstler:

Saumet wurde von verschiedenen elektronischen Musikmachern und Plattenlabels vorgestellt. Er hat auch in Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Belgrad, Berlin und anderen Städten gespielt.

Er schafft eine Umgebung für Meditation und Entspannung. Du kannst kommen, um seinen Sound durch Sounddesign und Visuals zu erkunden, zu entspannen oder sogar zu malen.

Bitte kommt Ihr 15 Minuten vor 19 Uhr, um euren Plätze zu sichern.
19 Uhr | 7€ (Spende für das Haus) oder 10€ inkl. Getränk.

Begrenzte Plätze.

Jeden Dienstag ab 18:00 Uhr. Seit inzwischen mehr als 10 Jahren ist der Dienstag mit ""Open Decks & Tischtennis"" im Humboldthain Club eine feste Instanz für Nordberliner Bewegungsjunkies. 

Ob die Platten zum Auflegen, die Kellen fürs Tischtennis oder die Ballerinas für den Floor – jeden Dienstag könnt ihr euer Spielzeug mitbringen und vom Wochenende entschlacken. 
Ob Techno, Drum and Bass, Disco oder Mamas Schlagersammlung – jeder Stil ist willkommen und wird vom Publikum abgefeiert. 

Daher bietet der ""Open Decks Abend"" vielen jungen DJs eine nach wie vor einzigartige Plattform zur Darbietung ihrer Künste und zum Austausch untereinander. 

Zwei Tischtennisplatten, genug Kellen für alle, ein Kickertisch, satter Sound aus den Boxen und nicht zuletzt leckeres Bier vom Fass, tragen dazu bei, dass eine stetig wachsende Zahl an gut gelaunten Menschen den Dienstag im Humboldthain Club zu ihrer Homebase erklärt hat. 

FAQ Frage: Wie läuft das mit dem Auflegen? 
Antwort: Zu Beginn jeder Veranstaltung liegt an der Mainbar eine Liste mit den DJ-Slots für den Abend aus. 

Jeder Slot geht eine halbe Stunde und jeder DJ darf nur einen (seinen) Namen in die Liste eintragen. 
Pro Abend gibt es 20 Slots!

Zenner, Berlin | October 10, 2024 | 19:00 - 00:00

Concentric Records returns to Berlin for the second edition of its live showcase at Zenner, continuing its exploration of immersive, genre-defying music. Staying true to the label’s vision, the event unites artists who navigate the spaces between sound, identity, and collective experience.

At the forefront is Gigi Masin, the Venetian composer and ambient music pioneer. With a career stretching back to the 1980s, Masin’s deeply emotional and improvisational compositions are characterized by serene atmospheres and delicate soundscapes. His ability to transport listeners into a world of calm reflection has made him a beloved figure in experimental music circles.

Also performing live is Temple Rat, a rising electronic artist from China who merges the ancient with the contemporary. Known for integrating traditional Chinese instruments like the guqin with modern ambient and electronic elements, her music evokes spiritual and mystical themes. Temple Rat’s performances are immersive, offering listeners a transcendent journey that blends ancient sounds with ethereal modernity.

On the decks, Marco Shuttle will deliver one of his signature deep and atmospheric sets. Shuttle is known for creating richly textured, hypnotic soundscapes that oscillate between dark, industrial and more experimental tones.

Opening the night will be Concentric Records’ own Simone Merli and Born In 1986, who will deliver experimental ambient DJ sets. As label founders, their sets reflect the eclectic and boundary-pushing ethos of Concentric Records, blending field recordings, deconstructed rhythms, and soundscapes that defy categorization.

Join us for a night of sound exploration, where artists blur the lines between genres, creating an unforgettable collective sonic experience.

Hypnotische Stadtnachtfahrten und lichtdurchflutete Sehnsuchtsorte. Eine Reise ins Niemandsland zwischen Traum und Wirklichkeit, Hoffnung und Ernüchterung, Alltag und Flucht. Die Musik von Conic Rose lässt sich nur schwer auf eine gängige Formel bringen. Je nach Blickwinkel kann man sie als Indie-Pop, Jazz, Ambient oder Electronica bezeichnen, wobei Indie-Jazz vielleicht eher zutrifft.

Wer ihr Debütalbum “Heller Tag“ (2023) noch nicht kennt, hat etwas verpasst und sollte es unbedingt nachholen. Das Album ist jedenfalls mehr als die Summe aufgezählter Stile: Es schwärmt in die Genres hinein, sammelt, fügt zusammen, lässt zerfallen und beginnt immer wieder von vorne, ohne sich irgendwo zu verlieren. Die Klangkaskaden der Band klingen im Ergebnis fokussiert, dabei sind viele der Stücke nur einmal aus der Improvisation heraus eingespielt und produziert worden. Für Trompeter Konstantin Döben und Pianist/Keyboarder Johannes Arzberger sowie Gitarrist Bertram Burkert, Bassistin Franziska Aller und Drummer Silvan Strauss ist barrierefreie Offenheit die Formel, die alles zusammenhält.

Ausgehend vom heiseren Ton der Trompete, eingebettet in schwebende Klangteppiche aus elektrischer und akustischer Gitarre, Keyboards, Bass und einem Schlagzeug, das Einflüsse von J.S. Bach, Krautrock, Thom Yorke oder Bonobo erkennen lässt, entwickelt sich auf “Heller Tag“ eine Musik, die ebenso ziellos wie unbeirrbar ihren Weg findet. Das Rezept liegt in der perfekten Mischung aus intuitivem Kalkül und kalkulierter Intuition. Die Lust am eigenen Klang ist bei Conic Rose in jedem Moment spürbar. Sie übersetzt sich in Bilder, deren eindringliche Beiläufigkeit sich auf der inneren Leinwand des zuhörenden Betrachters festsetzt und weiterlebt.

Conic Rose, das ist junger, urbaner und unheimlich offener Jazz, der mit Experimentierfreude und anmutigen Klanglandschaften das Publikum vom ersten Moment an in seinen Bann zieht. So war es beim letzten Konzert im Gretchen und so wird es wieder sein. Unbedingt hingehen.

Für diese Veranstaltung bieten wir ermäßigte Tickets an, um auch Menschen mit kleinerem Portmonee Zugang zu Kultur zu ermöglichen. Diese Kontingente sind limitiert und nur bei TixforGigs verfügbar. Wir vertrauen auf Eure Selbsteinschätzung: Wenn ihr könnt, bucht Standard-Tickets und überlasst die ermäßigten Kontingente denjenigen, die gerade sehr sparen müssen.

______________________________________________


Trying to place Conic Rose’s music into a standard formula is almost impossible. Depending on your perspective, you could describe it as indie pop, jazz, ambient, electronica, or as a soundtrack evoking its own images. It is all of these things, and yet much more than just the sum of the listed styles. If you haven't heard their debut album 'Heller Tag' (2023), you're missing out and should definitely go and get it.

Trumpet player and bandleader Konstantin Döben describes this phenomenon as both a blessing and a curse. But that is pure understatement, because it is precisely the unmistakable sound of his husky trumpet that gives the album its special aura, floating on the tranquil soundscapes of electric and acoustic guitars, keyboards, bass — and stoic drums, which bring together the influences of J.S. Bach, Krautrock, Thom Yorke or Bonobo into a sound aesthetic that generates associations with Jon Hassell, Nils-Petter Molvaer or Toshinori Kondo’s unforgettable band IMA. „Conic Rose” does not need a catchword, because the music describes itself.

Rounding out the band is Bertram Burkert on guitar, bass and synthesizers, Franziska Aller on bass, Johannes Arzberger on keyboard/piano and Silvan Strauss on drums.

As focused as the sound cascades of Conic Rose may be, many of them came about through improvisation: they were recorded, enriched with the other instruments, and finally produced. Nothing was prepared. The band surrendered to inner moods that they could only make audible by playing them. The process was a perfect mixture of intuitive calculation and calculated intuition. The magic formula for Döben and his crew is unhampered openness in all directions.

P/O Massacre (Switzerland/Portugal)

(PONOMAREV/OBRAZEENA MASSACRE)
There have been bands called Massacre before but this one is unlike any that preceded them. They are a duo of two established musicians – saxophonist and electronics player Anton Ponomarev and guitarist Anton Obrazeena.
Obrazeena is the leader of noise rock band Jars, while Ponomarev is a member of punk-avant-jazz-noise outfits (Teufelskeller, Brom, Speedball Trio, Catatonic Leisure). He performed with Jars, and contributed saxophone to some of their recordings, and eventually the idea for a two-man project began to take shape.

Anton Ponomarev: Saxophone, Modified Pocket Trumpet, Electronics
Anton Obrazeena: Guitar, FX, Samples, Synths


Debut self-titled album was released on Utech Records (US) in the beginning of 2021 (LP/CD)
A downtuned wall of distortion so thick you can almost scoop it up in your hands and rub it on your face. This album is an immersive world of pure sound that fills the room as easily as it empties out your skull – an exquisite journey to the endless soundscapes of drone.
2 years after P/O Massacre goes deeper in their immersive noise experimentation with their second album Aural Corrosion. In this collaboration album with Alex Buess (Swiss musician, composer, sound engineer and 16-17 band leader) and Merzbow (Masami Akita) an architecture of distortion, Moog processors, spring reverb, drone effects and more, then developed in different directions by two electronic/noise veterans. It’s a journey of pure sensation, destruction, and rebirth. A skull-vibrating sound decomposition to your face.

Aidan Baker (Nadja)

Experimental musician from Toronto, Ontario, Canada who has released numerous records both as a solo artist and as part of various side projects, including Nadja, ARC, Caudal and Mnemosyne.

Carla Boregas & Marina Cyrino

Carla Boregas is a Berlin-based Brazilian musician and sound artist. Her practice is focused on the creation of sonic environments through the manipulation of synthesizers, field recordings and acoustic sounds with emphasis on texture, repetition and sensoriality. She works across the spectrum of composition, improvisation, performance and sound installation. She also collaborates with artists from dance, film and theater fields. Recently Carla released her debut solo album called ""Pena ao Mar"" on the Swedish imprint iDEAL Recordings.

Marina Cyrino is a Brazilian flutist and sound artist currently based in Berlin. Her flute playing is characterized by singular techniques developed through the use of inside amplification. The rhythmic use of the flute, the extensive use of objects and balloons attached to the instrument, and the use of disassembled flute parts are other striking elements of her playing.

Riah: 
Riah Knight is a British-Romani artist based in Berlin. She first gained recognition in theatre and regularly performs, writes and composes music for productions at the Maxim Gorki Theatre and with the feminist collective Glossy Pain. Knight’s music paints an evocative landscape, woven within traditions of R&B, folk, trip-hop and performance poetry, her muscular songwriting and sultry voice create a sonic landscape for the political reimagining of female aggression and desire. Her upcoming EP ‘Wicked Laughter’ - out November 8th - is the latest offspring of her ongoing collaboration with producer Shaban. The latest single, ‘Yours’, came out in September 2024.

Nansea: 
Marek's Alter Ego Nansea (ˈnænsi) reclaims a homophobic slur, transforming it into a balm of polyphonic fractals, with synth waves and 80s-inspired drum machines. Marek’s wondrous voice glides above it all, defying genre and gender boundaries, residing in a secret realm between Rosalia and Ravel. Polish-born and raised in a small German town, Nansea eventually found home in Berlin. Her performances expanded from Kreuzkölln's bars to Berlin institutions like HKW, Berghain Kantine, and Torstrassen Festival. Collaborations with local artists led to work with the queer collective GOLOSA and the 2021 Sheena McGrandles project Dawn. Her lyrical focus on community, the queer experience, and gender fluidity has shaped a fluid, evolving style, from 2019’s Comfort EP to the upcoming single 'Kindness,' releasing in October 2024.",nansea,N/A

Die demo station von Rirkrit Tiravanija ist eine bühnenähnliche Skulptur und lädt Menschen dazu ein, etwas zu „demonstrieren“. Tiravanija versteht den Begriff dabei im doppelten Sinn – als politischen Protest oder als Vorführung von etwas, das jemand besonders gut kann oder gerne mag. Über die Laufzeit der Ausstellung bietet die demo station täglich Raum für öffentliche Auftritte.

Als Teil des öffentlichen Programms zur Ausstellung DAS GLÜCK IST NICHT IMMER LUSTIG von Rirkrit Tiravanija lädt der Gropius Bau zu einer monatlichen Serie Langer Abende ein. Neben der Performance finden am gleichen Abend eine Buchvorstellung mit Josephine Apraku, Eric Otieno Sumba, Sharonda Quainoo und Nadine Nzambisa Ngolo, eine Kochshow von Luiza Prado De O. Martins sowie eine Filmvorführung von Rirkrit Tiravanija und ein DJ-Set mit Ayzon statt.

Petra Hermanova ist eine Sängerin und Komponistin, die vorwiegend mit der Autoharp arbeitet. Die in Berlin lebende Künstlerin veröffentlichte ihr Solodebüt In Death’s Eyes im Oktober 2023 auf dem Label Unguarded. In neun Stücken, die zwischen Gesang und schweren, verzerrten Drones pendeln, setzt Hermanova die Autoharp, Stimme und Pfeifenorgel mit Techniken aus der Folk- und Sakraltradition ein, um sich mit den spirituellen und irdischen Dimensionen von schwerem Verlust und Trauer auseinanderzusetzen. In einer stringenten Darbietung von Schönheit, Schmerz und scharfsinniger Musikalität bringt Hermanova ein beeindruckendes Album hervor, auf dem der gefeierte Organist Denny Wilke an der Ladegast-Orgel des Merseburger Doms spielt. Das Album wurde für mehrere Preise nominiert, unter anderem für den tschechischen Grammy. Sie ist mit früheren Projekten international auf Tournee gegangen, darunter eine umfangreiche Zusammenarbeit mit Jon Eirik Boska und ihrer von der Kritik gefeierten Band Fiordmoss.

Bei der Veranstaltung werden ggfs. Foto- und Videoaufnahmen entstehen, auf denen Sie zu erkennen sein könnten. Mit Ihrem Besuch willigen Sie ein, dass diese Aufnahmen zur Kommunikation der Veranstaltung bzw. Ausstellung verwendet werden.

Hailed variously as “a glorious explosion of sex, noise and neuroses”, “horribly fascinating”, and “the worlds worst best band”, they are known across the realm for their wildly unpredictable and physical live performances, and have vowed to sacrifice themselves entirely for your entertainment during their show on the 10th of October. 

They are joined on the bill by Organza Ray and Klett Wandel.

Organza Ray is Eleni Poulou and Hilary Jeffery. Poulou has recorded and toured worldwide with many groups including The Fall and Shizuo. In 2022 in Berlin she formed Organza Ray together with Hilary Jeffery, who as well as composing, plays trumpet, trombone, tuba, piano and electronics. 

Klett Wandel is a kind of surreal, delusional demigod figure with a monthly show on 90mil radio. Through song, noise, story and movement he welcomes you into his warm embrace.

Die demo station von Rirkrit Tiravanija ist eine bühnenähnliche Skulptur und lädt Menschen dazu ein, etwas zu „demonstrieren“. Tiravanija versteht den Begriff dabei im doppelten Sinn – als politischen Protest oder als Vorführung von etwas, das jemand besonders gut kann oder gerne mag. Über die Laufzeit der Ausstellung bietet die demo station täglich Raum für öffentliche Auftritte.

Als Teil des öffentlichen Programms zur Ausstellung DAS GLÜCK IST NICHT IMMER LUSTIG von Rirkrit Tiravanija lädt der Gropius Bau zu einer monatlichen Serie Langer Abende ein. Neben dem DJ-Set finden am gleichen Abend eine Buchvorstellung mit Josephine Apraku, Eric Otieno Sumba, Sharonda Quainoo und Nadine Nzambisa Ngolo, eine Filmvorführung von Rirkrit Tiravanija sowie eine Performance von Petra Hermanova und eine Kochshow von Luiza Prado De O. Martins statt.

Der Produzent und Künstler Ayzon kombiniert in seinen Sets seine eigenen Produktionen mit Songs, die ihn inspirieren. Sein Vater, ein angolanischer DJ, machte ihn mit Kizomba, Jazz, Reggae und Zouk vertraut, während sein älterer Bruder ihm mit seiner Liebe zu R&B und Hip-Hop eine neue Welt eröffnete. Ayzons Sound spiegelt diese Prägung wider, indem er warme, fließende Akkorde mit sanften, groovigen Basslines und ansteckenden Drum-Patterns mischt und so einen Stil kreiert, der sich sowohl vertraut als auch erfrischend anders anfühlt. Anfang dieses Jahres veröffentlichte er sein neuestes Projekt Part Of The Story mit einer vielfältigen Auswahl internationaler und in Berlin ansässiger Vokalisten, das von namhaften Plattformen wie COLORS, NTS und BBC Radio aufgegriffen wurde.

ABOUT ||

Techno stands for equality, for gender and ethnic equality. We believe that one of the most important fundamental ideas of our Berlin techno subculture scene is the representation of a certain value system. Especially movements of social justice have a direct impact on our parallel society, where historically from freshly emerged scenes the revolutionary thought is living out freedoms that are often not yet set. All those who recognize, respect and uphold the communal, social values of our fragile parallel society are welcome.   

AWARENESS ||

The RSO awareness team is present at the club every weekend. Please do not hesitate to contact them if you feel uncomfortable for any reason. If you are unable to locate the awareness team, the other staff can call them for you.",SYNOID,https://www.instagram.com/sy_noid/

Das DJ-Duo Dream DJ Team, bestehend aus Anna Ullrich und Bitschu Batschu, hat sich einen festen Platz in der Dance-Szene Österreichs und Deutschlands erobert und bringt eine frische romantische Brise in die elektronische Musikszene. Mit ihren hypnotischen Melodien und energiegeladenen Sets versprechen sie ein unvergleichliches Erlebnis für alle Dance-Liebhaber.

Das neue DREAM DJ TEAM-Album ""Klopf Klopf"" ist ein bunter Mix aus verschiedenen Einflüssen und eine faszinierende Reflexion der Wiener Nachtlebenskultur. Die Musik transportiert die Energie und Vielfalt dieser Szene und ist in eine künstlerische Darstellung von verschiedenen Fiktionen, darunter Figuren wie Kirby, eingebettet. Diese Vielseitigkeit erstreckt sich über musikalische Genres und erzeugt eine einzigartige Klanglandschaft, die das lebendige und kreative Ambiente des Wiener Nachtlebens einfängt.

The event will take place on 11th October in Urban Spree in Berlin. To mark the occasion, we have invited a bunch of artists and bands from all over Europe and printed new label shirts.

Coming from Stockholm is the synthwave band Sex Kino, who should be familiar to some of you. Their debut album „Scream In The City"", which was released on HEARrec in 2020, sold out pretty quickly and became an insider tip among connoisseurs.

Also on the lineup we welcome back to Berlin the Augsburg based, belarusian band The Violent Youth. Known for their recognizable and typical eastern european postpunk sound, the band released their latest album “Na Igle” last winter on Atroffact Records on beautiful clear vinyl. Their last Mexico tour the past summer with the band Ploho will also be remembered by the locals for a long time to come.

As a special treat, the exceptional artist Alpha Sect from France, who has already released on labels such as SOIL, Oraculo and Crave Tapes itself, will play a live set. The lineup will be rounded off by Feines Tier's Keikee from Cologne, as well as the entire Crave Tapes label gang Desolate Discotheque, Unhealed and Xpresso Martina.

The new shirts and last tapes as well as band merchandise will be available at the merchandise stand at the entrance.

The name is a contraction of laptop and appetite. The laptop, for a long time the fetish creation instrument of the musicians and performers who are part of this collective born in 2002. The appetite for exploration, improvisation, the stage, the appetite to work together. Their work includes a collaboration with the French composer Eliane Radigue on her composition Elemental II (2002). In 2014 a residency at EMS Stockholm resulted in an audiovisual performance project titled: Borderless. Since, multiple transcending musical concepts have been developed and furthered with each of the resulting performances. Sonic concepts of text based speculative fiction, translated biological evolution into sine wave growing, noise improvisation are part of the trio’s output. Kaffe Matthews’ decade long experience of spacial live sound, Ryoko Akama’s sonic sensitivity with synthesizer and AGF’s digital and vocal execution bring a dynamic spectrum in sound without borders.
The sound artist and composer Ignaz Schick has made an international name for himself as a busy collaborator in the field of experimental music. Noise artist and DJ İpek Odabaşı works with intense sounds and hard, distorted beats. Both have known each other from the Berlin improvisation and experimental music scene for many years. For biegungen im ausland, the newly formed duo will combine İpek Odabaşıs electronic beat abstractions with the haptic, electro-acoustic turntablism of Ignaz Schick.

We are so excited to announce that for the next Cuddles in October, we will move to Aeden. 
We can host more of you, a bigger dancefloor, a covered outside area, a dimly lit play space and 12 hours of maddness and delusion.

On the main floor, we are joined by your Cuddles daddy Aaron Blau. His carefully selected sets can go from dark tribal rhythm and tech-house to uplifting ecstatic progressive vocal house.

He is joined by ketia, a keen ear for new and exciting music, alongside a curious, invested approach to community-building within the lisbon club scene; insisting on mixing as many genres as possible with a promise of bangers only.

Flying in from London Maria Malarie, a spearheading a new generation for whom genre is as fluid as gender. A resident of HOMODROP, ADONIS, and a founder of queer parties including HYSTERIA. Their sound encompasses the vintage and modern, blending everything with a seamless sonic dancefloor logic.

Bliss Inc. is the manifestation of a sonic ritual intent on guiding us through the internal journey towards self- discovery. Releases on Magicwire & Radiant Records have been heard in clubs and mixes across the world finding its way into the hearts of music lovers who longed for the art of progression back in its purest form.

And we're closing off with the absolute legend and a lesbian icon from Berlin that some of you might remember from the second cuddles edition DJ AYA. We don't need to add much more here, fuck it up, girlie.

Embracing themes of nostalgia and youth, Esben Weile Kjær’s installation will be paired with musical performances that each offer their own distinctive take on pop culture, art, satire and indie revival. Starting with a soundscape composed by frequent collaborator Europa, the first performance starts at midnight with shapeshifting artist Demisanté [FKA Demi Yo’Ko], followed by a DJ set by club pop producer Euvn. The night will culminate in a live set of lyrical and choreographic prowess by NYC royalty Miss Madeline, finally closing with a DJ set by Hoe_mies ringleader Meg10.

About the exhibition:

TRAUMA is pleased to present Milky Way, a solo exhibition by Danish artist Esben Weile Kjær. Kjær’s multidisciplinary work across sculpture and performance clashes the visual vocabularies of entertainment, fashion, and contemporary art in a critical investigation of youth-cultural rituals past and present.

In TRAUMA’s theatre space, Kjær has erected a large, navigable concrete structure that recalls two iconic, if melancholic, architectural typologies from the recent past: Soviet playgrounds and the quintessential WW2 bunkers along the West European coastline (known officially as the Atlantic Wall). The severe brutalist design of the artist’s construction is contrasted by a child-like playfulness, inviting audiences to climb the structure via its stairs or to try its built-in slide. The bunker’s exterior is embellished by several neon works on the building’s exterior and several stained-glass windows. While the neon works display fluorescent plants with diamond-crusted flowers crawling up the building’s exterior, the windows’ illuminated motifs are inspired by NASA imagery of new galaxies forming in the Milky Way. In this clash of spatial and visual iconographies, Kjær explores the status of bygone utopian visions under the sign of the perpetual new: how dreams are made material as aesthetics, how they inevitably fade, and how they might reawaken and remind us (of something) anew.

The show is part of Berlin Art Week 2024 Featured Section

Er wurde im San Gabriel Valley von Los Angeles geboren, einer kulturell vielfältigen Gegend, die seine Musik bis heute prägt. Zusammen mit den RaÌz-Brüdern gründete er Anfang der 2000er Jahre Droid Behavior, das unter anderem durch die Interface Warehouse Partys und das Label Droid Recordings bekannt wurde. Drumcell verbindet analoge und digitale Musikästhetiken und entwickelt einen hypnotischen, herausfordernden Techno-Stil. Seit Anfang der nuller Jahre arbeitet er immer wieder eng mit David Flores alias Audio Injection zusammen, der ebenfalls in Los Angeles aufgewachsen ist und in seiner Jugend anfing, auf Underground Warehouse Raves und Wüstenpartys aufzulegen. 2011 gründete Flores sein Techno-Alias Truncate und verlieh seiner Musik eine rohe, minimalistische Funkyness, die seine Tracks bis heute in die Sets der Techno-Größen spült. Zur heutigen Klubnacht spielen die beiden nach über vier Jahren wieder einmal zusammen in Berghain. Zum 25. Soundstream-Jubiläum spielt unter anderem Romy Pope alias Snow in der Panorama Bar, die nach einer typischen Hamburg-Sozialisierung mit Ladomat-Volontariat, Pudel-Club-Residency und Dial-Connection inzwischen in Berlin lebend auch hier ihre Partyreihe Saturnite veranstaltet.

“I make noise and sometimes organize it in semi recognizable patterns”, says Moe Espinoza aka Drumcell about his music. He was born in the San Gabriel Valley of Los Angeles, a culturally diverse area that still influences his music today. In the early 00s, he and the Raíz brothers founded Droid Behavior, a group that gained notoriety for its Interface warehouse parties and the Droid Recordings label. Drumcell combines analogue and digital music aesthetics, developing a hypnotic, challenging techno style. Since the early 00s, he has been working regularly with David Flores aka Audio Injection, who also grew up in Los Angeles and started off DJing at underground warehouse and desert raves. In 2011, Flores launched his techno alias Truncate, giving his music a raw, minimalist funk that continues to be heard in the sets of techno giants to this day. For this weekend's Klubnacht, they will be joining forces once again on the Berghain floor after more than four years. For Soundstream's 25th anniversary he will also be joined by Romy Pope aka Snow made the rounds in Hamburg with practical training at Ladomat, a residency at Golden Pudel Club and a connection to Dial, meanwhile living in Berlin, where she puts on her Saturnite party series.",Ostgut,https://www.berghain.berlin/de/event/77232/

Mr Cigarette Butt:
Years spent listening to old cassettes, then old vinyls that sounded devastated but pure at the same time. Growing up with a voracious passion and addiction like a drug to music, especially from the underground scene, moving from the wildest rock and roll to the most synthetic sounds of the 80s, all well and truly stuffed with unhealthy lives. Dark punk with roots as deep as the blues. After many vicissitudes from Italy he ended up in Berlin among the city's wreckage. DJ, musician, promoter and much more.

Dj Hunky Dory:

Join us for an immersive sonic journey as we blend music and rituals to welcome the arrival of autumn and prepare for the seasonal shift.

Our lineup features seasoned veterans of organic, deep, and psychedelic soundscapes, offering you a sonic experience on one of the most advanced sound systems, the Martion Audio HiFi Horn.

In two distinct spaces, we’ve carefully curated a program designed to guide you through this transition with care. On the ‘Home’ floor, you'll experience an eclectic DJ set by the visionary Marylou, a percussive Sound Bath and Cacao Ceremony by Mitotili.

Our special guest, Ron Trent from Chicago, just back from his debut WARM EU live tour, will immerse us in resonant WARM sonics, capturing the essence of rhythm, harmony, and soulful vibrations. Additionally, Venecia Runningwolf will lead an Indigenous Sound Journey, offering live performances on the Guzheng and Flute.

Continue your journey of discovery in the ‘Sound Bar’, where Sarah Wreath presents a live set, designed for deep listening to specific frequencies as a sound meditation in conjunction with the horn speaker. This will be accompanied by ambient and experimental DJ sets from our favourite storytellers, Nathalia and Marco Shuttle.

Each element invites deep listening and introspection, creating a harmonious atmosphere for your journey. As the event unfolds, you can unwind in our sauna or enjoy a massage, letting the soothing music and tranquil atmosphere support your inner and collective experiences.

Nurture your mind, body, and soul as we gather in harmony with the changing season.

HYPERKLASSIꓘ V.1 is the distillation of five years of work in dismembering and deconstructing the rotting remains of an hegemonic culture: the Western musical tradition. The shreds reassembled into fluorescent orchids, rain-flooded forests, dreamed cities, and deep waters where humans swim who understand the language of fish, corals, and constellations in the sky above. But it is also a very personal sound diary, the manifesto of a liberating, playful and quite ignorant electronic music practice, and a chaotic declaration of love.

The album presentation will be followed by a live set by AIEL, who also contributed to the album with a track, and a DJ-set by KC.

The Headhunters, das legendäre Jazz-Funk-Ensemble unter der Leitung des Schlagzeugers Bill Summers und des Perkussionisten Mike Clark sowie Donald Harrison am Altsaxophon, feierte 2023 sein 50-jähriges Bestehen. Jetzt sind sie auf einer ausgedehnten Europa Tournee und kommen bei uns im Gretchen vorbei.

Nur wenige Bands können auf eine so wechselvolle Geschichte zurückblicken. Jedes einzelne Mitglied der 1973 von Herbie Hancock um die Aufnahmen der klassischen Alben “Head Hunters“ und “Thrust“ herum gegründeten Band, hat Geschichte geschrieben. Zusammen führten sie Fusion und Funk zusammen, definierten das Genre des Funk-Jazz und machten den Synthesizer im Jazz endgültig salonfähig. Was dabei herauskam, ist bis heute sensationell. In den Melodien klingen Curtis Mayfield, James Brown und Sly Stone durch, die Rhythmen sind in Funk, Soul und R’n’B verwurzelt, doch die Sensibilität und die Freiheit kommen aus dem Jazz. Ein geerdeter und tanzbarer Sound, der den Jazz einem breiteren Publikum zugänglich gemacht hat und so manchen Genre Puristen der damaligen Zeit nachhaltig verstörte.

1975 löste sich die Verbindung zu Herbie Hancock. Seitdem sind acht weitere Alben ohne Hancocks Beteiligung entstanden, angefangen mit Survival of the Fittest (1975) und Straight from the Gate (1977) sowie zuletzt Speakers In the House (2022) und Live From Brooklyn Bowl (2023). Dabei ist nichts von der spirituellen Energie und Innovationsfreude der Anfangstage verloren gegangen. Ihre Mischung aus Jazz, Funk und Fusion inspirierte über Jahrzehnte hinweg Musiker*innen aller Genres und wurde in den 80er und 90er Jahren von unzähligen Hip-Hop Künstler*innen gesampelt.

Die aktuelle Band besteht aus einem Quintett mit Clark, Summers und Harrison sowie dem Bassisten Chris Severin und dem Pianisten Kyle Roussel.

________________________________________


Few bands can boast a history as fortuitous and storied as The Headhunters. That history began back in 1973 when iconic musician Herbie Hancock formed the Headhunters - saxophonist/clarinetist Bennie Maupin, bassist Paul Jackson Jr., drummer Harvey Mason, and percussionist Bill Summers. What each member of the Headhunters brought to the table helped forge a timeless legacy and history that most bands can only dream of. Their blend of jazz with funk and rock reached millions of fans of jazz, rock, funk, and R&B alike. With over a million albums sold, the band’s legacy would inspire musicians of every genre for years to come, be sampled by various rap artists throughout the '80s and '90s, and influence countless musicians' styles of playing today.


The Headhunters’ impact remains a global phenomenon, and their time with Hancock proved to be a life changing experience. The band has released 6 more full length albums including ""Thrust"" in 1974 with the addition of drummer Mike Clark, struck out on their own in 1975, without Hancock's involvement, on ""Survival of the Fittest” and on ""Straight from the Gate” in 1977.


After a twenty year hiatus they reunited in 1998 with Hancock for the Verve album ""Return of the Headhunters"" with Clark, Jackson, and Summers performing as the Headhunters actively touring until the March 2021 passing of Jackson. In addition to original members Clark and Summers, the line up of the band consists of Chris Severin on bass, Donald Harrison on saxophone and Kyle Roussel on piano.

 

“The Headhunters’ spirit music spans generations, genres and the cosmos itself.”
- Jazziz Magazine

“This record serves as '“Actual Proof” that the sources behind jazz fusion’s fount still have a lot to say.”
- Downbeat Magazine

“The pronounced Cubano-Latin swing and sway is positively infectious in its breezy air and may well compel not only repeated playings of the disc in very quick succession but perhaps also even some inclusions on more than a few Best of the Year lists.”
- All About Jazz

She is not only a fantastic singer, but also a songwriter, guitarist, producer, mixer and musical director for various productions. The list of artists she has worked with so far reads like pure name dropping: Questlove, DRAM, Chance The Rapper's Band, The Social Experiment, Intellexual, Che Lingo, Jean Deaux, TA-KU, BARKAA, Winston Surfshirt and Sampa The Great - to name just a few.

But Milan Ring's own music is even more exciting: she released her debut album ""I'm Feeling Hopeful"" in 2021 and was celebrated by NME, The Guardian and Crack Magazine. Her second album ""Mangos"" was recently released: ten fantastic, smooth, perfectly produced songs between R&B, electronica and modern pop. The songs ""Photograph"" and ""High As The Moon"" are particularly hard to get out of your head once you've heard them. Milan Ring said in an interview that she aims to use her songs ""to cultivate love for others, but also to build a romantic relationship with myself, with life and with nature"". Her guiding principle: ""Keep your heart open and stay vulnerable, allow the rest to unfold as it should.""

ABOV is a safe space created by FLINTA* for FLINTA*, for all the beauties that have ever been harassed, discriminated against or worse just for being themselves.

FLINTA* is an umbrella term representing female, lesbian, inter*, non-binary/enby, trans*, and agender people.

After the first successful party in NYC, ABOV is now being deployed in Berlin for the first time with a line up of the most hidden and polished gems of the coral sea of diversity.

To open the night we will have the honor to host grinderteeth, a renown musician and artist that has just recently led the new Lab.oratory FLINTA* party SLIT in Berghain among her many other performances and musical sets.

To continue the night, we’ll have Cvntmom, the vanguardist post erotic performer, club owner and head of Berlin’s most underground and quality hotpot party: diskota forte take us into really wet and steamy frequencies.

As we go deep into the night the majestic touch of Synthtati will be paired with Domi in a b2b that will make the eyes wide shut melody seem like a child’s lullaby.

To close the ceremony Krohm will glitch whatever is left in our souls in order to leave us all like empty vessels ready to be possessed by the energy of the queen of the night herself.

The whole night will be hosted by one of the strongest and most beautiful beings in Berlin, The one and only Frau Dark.

If you attend our events, and you are not FLINTA* remember where you are at all times and that this is a space created for us that you may enjoy and support respectfully.

Für sich genommen sind beide schon episch, zusammen sind sie eine Naturgewalt. Auf ihrer Begin Anew Tour '24 bringen sie einen elektrisierenden Soundmix mit, in dem alle Genres miteinander kollidieren. House, Hip-Hop, Electronica und Jazz (to name a few...) verbinden sich mit der Poesie Ursula Ruckers und ihrer reichen, akzentuierten Stimme, die wohl zu den größten und schönsten lebendigen Instrumenten der Welt gehört. Das Tourprogramm umfasst neue Werke, klassische Tracks von Ursulas Platten sowie Songs aus den zahlreichen Kollaborationen mit Künstler*innen wie 4Hero, The Roots, King Britt, Hannes Bieger, Charles Webster und vielen anderen.

Seit fast drei Jahrzehnten begeistert Rucker das Publikum auf der ganzen Welt mit ihrer mitreißenden Bildsprache. Aufgewachsen in einem Vorort von Philadelphia, begann sie in ihren Zwanzigern bei Open Mice Sessions aufzutreten. 1994 gelang ihr der internationale Durchbruch, als sie die Lead-Stimme für den Klassiker „Supernatural“ von King Britt und seinem Projekt Firefly sang. Ihr Debütalbum ""Supa Sista"" (2021) erreichte ein breites Publikum und strotzt wie alle ihre Soloalben vor Kraft und musikalischer Vielfalt. Mit ihrem Stil, der Poesie und Politik mit Philly-Soul, Jazz, Hip-Hop und Electronica verbindet, verpackt sie komplexe Zusammenhänge in zugängliche Bilder, ohne je belehrend zu wirken. Über allem schweben ihre Texte, die Musik verleiht den Worten Flügel und die klare Schönheit ihrer Stimme transportiert die Botschaft in unsere Herzen.

Tim Motzer ist ein Gitarrist, der die Vielfalt liebt, ein Pionier des Sounds - bekannt für seine unverwechselbare akustisch-elektronische Gitarrenstimme, bei der er Live-Looping, Bogenspiel, Elektronik und präparierte Techniken einsetzt. Seine Arbeit als Leader und Sideman kreuzt viele musikalische Welten, darunter Jazz, Fusion, Prog, Hip-Hop, Soul, Electronica und Avantgarde.

Pharmakon's live musical act has been described as confrontational and concise, attempting to ""cross the boundary between performer and audience"". Her songs are completely prearranged both live and in recordings, more focused on perfecting a sound rather than generating randomness in noise.
Swamp Booking presents iconic noise/industrial artist Pharmakon for an 4 date exclusive tour in Europe/UK for March 2023. Having released some of noise and power electronics most revered records on the legendary label Sacred Bones, Pharmakon continues to be an unmatched force in underground music.""
""Equally as revered as they are an anathema to audiences worldwide, the oppressive noise wall crafted by Kollaps has cemented the band in the history pages of industrial music. Kollaps' live shows are known for their vehement and visceral nature where their destructivist ideology manifests into self-mutilation, vitriolic, and violent live performances.""
""Lana Del Rabies is a captivating force in underground dark electronic and fringe heavy music. Her distinct blend of industrial, gothic noise, and experimental metal delves into the esoteric brutality of human existence in a world overshadowed by the threat of apocalypse.

Er wuchs im belgischen Lüttich auf und begann in den 90er Jahren mit dem Rappen im Trio Malfrats Linguistiques, aus dem später die weltbekannte Hip-Hop-Gruppe Starflam hervorging.

Musikalisch bewegt sich Baloji zwischen afrikanischer Musik, Rap, französicher SingerSongwriter Tradition, afro-amerikanischem Soul, Funk und Jazz. Den Weg dazu hat er über HipHop und die Technik des Samplens gefunden. Inspiriert hat ihn aber auch elektronische Musik. Balojis Ausdauer und Widerstandsfähigkeit steht im Zentrum seiner Arbeit. So schafft er es, all diese verschiedenen Einflüsse miteinander in Einklang zu bringen und damit seine kreativen Projekte anzureichern.

2008 veröffentlichte er sein erstes, sehr persönliches Soloalbum “Hôtel Impala“, das mit Gold und zwei Octaves de la Musique ausgezeichnet wurde.  2010 folgte das Album “Kinshasa Succursale“ und 2015 die EP “64 Bits and Malachite“. 

Nach seinem dritten Album “137 Avenue Kaniama“ von 2018 ist er nun mit einem monumentalen Projekt zurück: „Augure/Omen“ (2023) ist sein erster Spielfilm als Regisseur und erzählt die Geschichte eines Mannes, der aus Belgien in sein kongolesisches Heimatdorf zurückkehrt. Der Film wird von einem gewaltigen Soundtrack begleitet, der aus 4 EPs besteht, die jeweils die Perspektive eines der vier Hauptprotagonisten des Films einnehmen.

Der Soundtrack steckt voller Kollaborationen: Sampa The Great, Dj Lag, Jose James, IDPIzzle, Jamilia Woods, Natalie Bergman und viele andere erschaffen gemeinsam mit Baloji musikalische Welten der Extraklasse. Das Ergebnis ist eine fesselnde Mischung aus Hip-Hop, Afrobeats, Electronica, traditionellem Gesang, kongolesischer Rumba und vielen anderen Stilen.

Für diese Veranstaltung bieten wir ermäßigte Tickets an, um auch Menschen mit kleinerem Portmonee Zugang zu Kultur zu ermöglichen. Diese Kontingente sind limitiert und nur bei TixforGigs verfügbar. Wir vertrauen auf Eure Selbsteinschätzung: Wenn ihr könnt, bucht Standard-Tickets und überlasst die ermäßigten Kontingente denjenigen, die gerade sehr sparen müssen.

_____________________________________


Baloji, born in Lubumbashi, Congo (DC), is a rapper, songwriter, director, poet, stylist and actor. He grew up in Liège, Belgium. In the 90s, Baloji began rapping with the trio Malfrats Linguistiques, which went on to become the world-renowned hip-hop group: Starflam.

In 2008, he released his highly personal first solo album: Hôtel Impala, certified gold and won two Octaves de la Musique awards. In 2010, a second solo album, Kinshasa Succursale.

In 2015, a solo EP, 64 Bits and Malachite.  In 2018, he released his third solo album, 137 Avenue Kaniama, awarded the Octave musiques du monde. In 2023, Baloji's début full-length feature film Augure/Omen received the Prix de la Première Voix in the Un Certain Regard selection at the Cannes Film Festival, and the Prix de la Mise en Scène at the Angoulême Film Festival.

The film inspired 4 12-track EPs. Each EP takes the point of view of one of the film's four protagonists. Hip-hop, Afrobeats, electro, traditional songs, Congolese rumba, etc. The project takes on multiple incarnations and artistic inspirations. A captivating, deep and powerful aesthetic.

A fascinating variation on the story of the eponymous feature film. The album includes featuring artists with singular universes such as: Sampa The Great, Dj Lag, Jose James, IDPIzzle, Jamilia Woods, Natalie Bergman, Metronomy, Wharola, and many more.

For this event we offer discounted tickets to give people with less money still access to culture. These quotas are limited and only available at TixforGigs. We trust in your self-assessment: If you can, please book standard tickets and leave the reduced tickets to those who have to save money at the moment.

EUPHORIK brings Valkhør to Berlin!

Hard techno's most infamous antihero, Vendex, is the mastermind behind Valkhør, a multi-channel concept, brand and creative realm encompassing a record label and worldwide audio-visual shows.

With a dark, pounding signature soundscape ranging from hard techno to EBM and industrial, Valkhør embodies the musical and creative vision of the masked techno sorcerer Vendex, who has built a devoted following since he burst onto the scene in 2018. 

VALKHØR is a fictional world with mythical lore divided into four visually different themed settings characterized by fire, ice, sand and a cyberpunk-inspired environment influenced by futuristic, historical and fantasy elements.

The narrative was created by Vendex himself and brings the label and event concept to life.
Valkhør is where the dark vision of Vendex, the creative force our own world could not contain, finds its full expression.",doomenicc,https://www.instagram.com/euphorikberlin/

⬤ ABOUT PARADISE GARAGE ⬤
We believe that great musical traditions should never die. Our Paradise Garage party series is a tribute to the legendary New Yorker Paradise Garage club that was the place where House music and Disco bloomed between 1976 and the time of its closure in 1987.

Our Paradise Garage remains 100% loyal to the musical tradition of the New Yorker club and his legendary resident Larry Levan. You will not hear Techno, or any of the common modern interpretations of House music and Disco at the party.

Our Paradise Garage is also defined as a sex-positive party. It requires a dress code (read below), and is a safe space for kinky communities and LGTBQ, escorted by a professional and devoted awareness team.

The dress code is meant to emphasize the border between the everyday and the space we create. We wish to encourage our guests to safely express themselves through fashion and their individual choices of clothes and accessories.


⬤ WHAT TO EXPECT ⬤
⊛ A musical homage to Paradise Garage: classic House and old-school Disco.
⊛ No streetwear! Come colorful, kinky and creative.
⊛ Secret DJ lineup.

⬤ MUST READ ⬤
⊛ The Paradise Garage has a strict no-photo policy. We have a designated photobooth with our photographer, where photos can be taken of those who wish for it.
⊛ The Paradise Garage is a safe space for any ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. Any sign of racism, antisemitism, sexism or homophobia will not be tolerated.
⊛ In addition, you are to respect the personal space of any fellow dancer. In case you feel that you have been treated wrongly, or that your space has been violated, please notify our awareness team or our staff.
⊛ DRESS-CODE: * Swimsuits * Costumes * Leather * Latex * Naked * Super Heroes * Lingerie * Colorful Festival Style.

Such an incredible emotion to remember the first time. It has been 5 years since we first opened our doors, since the first beats flooded the dancefloor, since the first time we met, since we saw you dancing for the first time. 

We want to celebrate with you 5 years of techno, darkness, dance, sweat, love and friendship. For that we have prepared a very special event orchestrated by our DJ residents and some old and new friends to have an unforgettable night, the last one together this season.

We are back to share an orgiastic celebration with you all on a new dark location where we will learn together to play hide and seek, to sweat together and dance in a collaborative manner. Different areas to relax, dance, sweat, drink and talk to each other, meet new people and greet old known ones. Come and enjoy the techno and pleasure, where individuals reconstruct into a mass of bodies which dances, moves and sweats as one on the dancefloor: skin to skin, feeling together, feeling the hard beat, the pounding on their ears and the lights hiding and showing precious human creatures on ecstasy. 
How nice to be all together once again, celebrating another night of hedonism, free sexual expression and joy.

Please remember the Community Guidelines: at our events you are expected to embrace them.

NO: Racism, Sexism, LGTBIQ+phobia, Hate, Violence, Agephobia, Bodyshaming or Fascism.

Der schottische Musikproduzent, DJ und Live-Act Barry Can’t Swim kommt im Oktober für sein einziges Deutschlandkonzert nach Berlin in das Astra Kulturhaus!

Als einer der aufregendsten Künstler:innen der elektronischen Musik machte Barry Can't Swim zunächst mit einer Reihe von Veröffentlichungen im Jahr 2020 (u.a. bei Shall Not Fade) auf sich aufmerksam, bevor er 2022 beim Ninja Tune-Sublabel Technicolour für seine sensationelle EP, „More Content“ (die bis heute über 20 Millionen Streams erreicht hat) unterschrieb. Im Jahr 2023 erschien Barrys Debütalbum, „When Will We Land?“, das bei seiner Veröffentlichung auf Platz 12 der britischen Albumcharts und Platz 1 in den britischen Dance-Albumcharts einstieg und sein bisher umfangreichstes und vielfältigstes Projekt darstellt. Das 11-Track-Album, das von BBC Radio 1 zum Dance-Album des Jahres gewählt wurde, bewegte sich zwischen Deep House und Jazz und wurde von Mixmag, DJ Mag, The Times, Evening Standard, NME, Billboard, Clash und vielen anderen gelobt. Barry wurde außerdem bei den DJ Mag Awards als „Breakthrough Producer“ ausgezeichnet und bei den BRIT Awards 2024 in der Kategorie „Dance Act“ gegen Becky Hill, Calvin Harris, Fred Again... und Romy nominiert.

Bereits im März spielte Barry Can’t Swim eine restlos ausverkaufte Live-Show im Berliner Säälchen. Im Herbst geht der schottische Live-Act nun erneut auf Tour und macht dabei auch Halt in Berlin! ",TrinityMusic,https://trinitymusic.de/events/berlin/barry-cant-swim

Puce Mary is the solo moniker of Danish-born artist Frederikke Hoffmeier. 
With a long career in experimental electronic music - Puce Mary has a reputation for intense live performances that span from gripping renditions of cinematic composition to the full-on fury of off-the-cuff harsh noise. Oft-identified with the now-generation of industrial noise, the project’s recent 
endeavours explores the field of sound more broadly than before, unfurling a complex sonic and literary narrative of tension and release. Tot Onyx is the solo project of Tommi Tokyo, who is also known as part of the experimental performance duo Group A, which was active until 2020.

DJ Sotofett operates the booth with the authority of a selector who is firmly in control of proceedings: never flustered, with a masterful command of energy and flow. 

His selections span the past five decades of soundsystem music, with a particular focus on soulful; groove heavy House, Techno and Electro, while his extended sets incorporate Jazz, Funk, Hip-Hop and Dub. Playing prominently with vinyl, his mixing is seamless and playful: full of neat chops and daring transitions. 

For going on 20 years, DJ Sotofett has been releasing a steady stream of records through revered labels such as Tresor and Honest Jon’s, as well as his own labels Wania and Sex Tags Mania / Amfibia. He has been throwing regular label parties at OHM and Tresor since 2014, while he also recently launched the dub focused party, Resonance of Dub. 

Having already been lucky enough to witness a DJ Sotofett all nighter in the flesh, you can take our word that this is going to be proper! 



The ethos of Trip the Light is based on creating a night with no frills, that is completely music-centric, focused on diversity, inclusivity and intimacy. Our music interests are broad and ever evolving but are rooted in UK soundsystem music.

This time, we bring you a stellar lineup to the table : PYSH, SEIUN, and Franz Matthews will all embark you in a sonic journey going from groovy and cosmic Indie Dance, to the realms of Melodic Techno, Dark Disco, with extra hints of hi-powered Italo.

PYSH
=====
Pysh, is a Polish DJ and music producer living in Berlin. His performances have permanently recorded in the lineups of the largest Polish music clubs and festivals, sharing the stage with leading artists of the world electronic scene, such as Eelke Kleijn, Robag Wruhme, Guy J or Kollektiv Turmstrasse.

In addition to balancing between the house, indie and melodic genres in his productions, sets and live acts, Pysh interweaves ethnic and folk sounds, which are a kind of hallmark of his work, which regularly travels all around the world under the aegis of such labels like Ritter Butzke, Jeahmon, Click, or Einmusik.

SEIUN
=====
French DJ and producer based in Berlin / Paris, SEIUN's music vibrates in a mixture of groovy bass, chuggy retro synths, touches of acid sonorities and vintage percussion, forming a powerfully bassy and eclectic combo that identifies itself as indie dance / EBM / italo disco. She perceives music as a universal way to connect with oneself and others, in a trance and a journey built on the moment to let go and focus on the present.

Recently becoming a member of the Parisian collective apero notturno, she has already conquered many places such as Sisyphos, Katerblau, Renate, Kitkat, as well as Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, the Netherlands and many others. Also a producer, her latest releases are on the Club Mackan and Nein labels.


FRANZ MATTHEWS
================
Now grounded in Berlin, the franco-german music producer, DJ & Live Act likes to blend worlds together. Either wandering through cosmic, spiritual, or other mental realms, mixed with sonic influences gathered from his travels around the world, Matthews always keeps faithful to one thing : trying to make people dance, while adding something meaningful out of their experience.

His studio work also always embodies a strong sense of ethos, commitment, and attention to detail. A winning combination that’s seen him release music on imprints such as Eskimo Recordings, AEON, ROAM, Heimlich, as well as his own label HIFI/LOFI Records, while collaborating and getting remixed by the likes of Aera, Chaim, Local Suicide, The Organism…

Rave transcendence will come in the form of object blue’s liminal wanderings between the club and experimental realms, Emma dj’s hard, gritty and indefinable sounds, and Softmatter’s bass-heavy avant-pop with a dark edge that has long served as a refuge from the struggles and adversity of authoritarianism. There’ll be an explosive live performance from underground cult duo Bassvictim whose particular brand of youthful hedonism comes in a unique form of grunge-y industrial dance they call “basspunk,” as well as performances and DJ sets by XD Erica, Binghi, and Or:la. Also taking part are Evita Manji, MAKOSSIRI, and Lutto Lento, along with Blood of Aza’s gift for purveying extremes that deftly ricochet between dissonant noise and delicate atmospherics and a live set by sound artist and experimental ambient musician NEXCYIA. Based on his recent Exodus album, the performance combines immersive sound design and textural soundscapes to create an otherworldly reflection of his family’s journey from Texas to Los Angeles in the 1970s. The centerpiece of the night comes from Jas Lin 林思穎 and Hearthealer, who premiere their “NEMATOCYST” interactive performance in Berlin in an effort to excavate a potent energetic force of aliveness for their audience to savor. Named after the stinging cells of jellyfish, the collaboration between the respective performance artist/choreographer and writer/producer/DJ is a ritualistic ceremony for facilitating a habitat of spacious freedom and summoning possibility through a collective altered state. 

Introduced into the common lexicon by Davis in his famed TechGnosis: Myth, Magic, and Mysticism in the Age of Information, the 1998 book’s titular notion proposes a cultural phenomenon where technology is not seen as antithetical to spirituality, but as a tool that can enhance and facilitate spiritual practices.

Gegründet wurde der Chor von der Sängerin Natalie Maddix, um die Musikstile House und Gospel zusammenzubringen – ein Ansatz, den auch viele US-amerikanische Produzent*innen und Sänger*innen im New York der 90er Jahre verfolgten, die ihre Wurzeln in den afroamerikanischen Kirchen hatten und uns neben anderen die größten House-Hits dieser Zeit bescherten. Einigen dieser Songs werden wir sicher auch beim Auftritt von Harrsn with House Gospel Choir begegnen, die uns - natürlich am Sonntag - in abgespeckter Clubbesetzung inklusive DJ zur heiligen Tanzmesse in die Säule einladen.

The House Gospel Choir is a London-based vocal group that first performed at the Glastonbury Festival in 2014. It was founded by singer Natalie Maddix with the aim of bringing together the musical styles of house and gospel – an approach pursued by many US producers and singers in New York in the 90s, whose roots in African-American churches paved the way for some of the biggest house hits of the decade. We're sure to hear a few of these songs during the performance (on Sunday, of course) by Harrsn with House Gospel Choir, leading a holy dance mass in the Säule with a slimmed-down club line-up and DJ. At Panorama Bar, Massimiliano Pagliara will be surrounded by a few musical mates, including Australian DJ/producer Eluize, who just released Curious Bliss, a summery, acid-soaked house EP on his label Funnuvojere.

Dispatches of wars, disasters, and crises circulate with unceasing regularity and ease, while an overwhelming feeling of powerlessness underscores an ever more incomprehensible world at odds with its own logic. The impossible has become possible. Reality is stranger than fiction. The tenth edition of Creamcake’s 3hd, with its title “The Shadows That Linger,” probes this uncanny realm where the ordinary becomes strange in an “always-already” defined by digital technology, nostalgia, and deterritorialization. Wading deep into this hauntological space between the familiar and the unfamiliar from October 19 to November 3, the festival will examine the spiritual and the ghostly, the ambiguous and the uncertain, alongside those historical, political, cultural, and social relics and reverberations that continue to affect us all.

The interdisciplinary program aims to open up to the political potential of discomfort. In experiencing and engaging with the alien and the otherworldly, “The Shadows That Linger"" will spend the present working through the specters of the past in an attempt to transform dread into a drive for a better future. A decade since its first edition, the concerns raised in 3hd 2015’s “The Labor of Sound in a World of Debt” seem almost trite compared to the sheer scale and impact of today’s cultural flux, social disparity, and environmental degradation, and the mass violence, destruction, and suffering that continues to unfold globally. Perhaps it’s worth reflecting on this seemingly simpler past as part of a circuitous chain of events leading to the present, while remembering that chains can be broken and shadows do fade.",creamcake01,http://3hd-festival.com

In a rare and not-to-be-missed DJ set, Vienna's own musical composer and artist Punzmann will demonstrate the incredible versatility of electronic music. And of course brace yourself for Yulo X's eclectic journey through the realms of house, bass music and techno. He will not only serve up a mind-bending set but also treat you to fresh tracks from his latest album. 
Rounding out this stellar lineup is Berlin's Arno Cao with melodic, groove-oriented house that's guaranteed to keep you moving.

Since it's a daytime event and a small venue, there will be limited capacities.

STOLEN were formed by vocalist Liang Yi, guitarist Fangde, bassist Jun, drummer Yufeng, and keyboardist Duan Xuan while studying at the Sichuan Conservatory of Music in 2009. In 2012 Formol, a French VJ, joined the band.
In 2017 they met Mark Reeder, who was on a tour in China with his film B-Movie and was performing at the Morning House Festival in Chengdu. Mark was really impressed by STOLEN’s brilliant live performance, and after the gig, they decided to go into the studio together to record a demo. In January 2018, the band traveled to Berlin to record their second album, ‘Fragment’ which was again produced by Mark Reeder and Micha Adam. The band wanted to soak in the atmosphere of the city and especially its Techno-club-scene and inject their impressions into their music. It was during the production of this album that Mark decided to reactivate his label MFS, especially for the release of Fragment in Europe. It was a challenging objective. Fragment was released in China in September 2018, and in Europe in early 2019 on MFS.
Mark introduced STOLEN’s music to New Order’s Bernard Sumner who was very impressed, and not only by their music but also by their spirit and ambition. The band was invited as a guest for NEW ORDER on their European tour in 2019.
STOLEN has the wild and sexy nature of traditional rock music, while blending the sanity and restraint of electronic music. Their high-energy sound integrated techno, dark-wave, and post-punk influences, is both introspective, exploratory and irresistibly danceable.
Remolding the rock band configuration into a hyper-synchronized dance engine, with a highly explosive audio and handcrafted-visual live performance, STOLEN has a strong recognition and a high degree of aesthetic unity in sound, vision and scene, is undoubtedly one of the leader of indie rock scene in China.

'Passive Progressive' lands in the form of 8 enthralling tracks that take us through dreamlike and psychedelic echoing territories, where Korf’s modulating electronics and effected vocals ripple over the grooving rhythm section of percussion and bass supplied by Kokus and Chitka. We’ve no doubt that the sound that Love-Songs have crafted with This new album will be enthusiastically received by all sonic voyagers and fans of the label, and we’re over the moon to welcome them to the Phase Group family.

Twen is a lo-fi, ethereal indie punk band born out of the Boston Punk scene, formed in 2017 by vocalist Jane Fitzsimmons and guitarist Ian Jones. Both were playing in bands or putting on shows in the area's fertile DIY house show community, and they soon got together to write songs that were part slightly psychedelic rock and part moody pop. Fitzsimmons' vocal style in the band's earliest days relied on emphatically sung but hard-to-discern lyrics, designed to draw the listener's attention away from prescribed narratives. After moving to Nashville, the duo released a cassette called Twen Live, consisting of five songs recorded at their first show. The band toured steadily throughout the next two years. Described by Vice i-D as ""a DIY band about to make it big"", in 2019 they signed on with indie label Frenchkiss Records for the release of their studio debut 'Awestruck'. In 2024 Twen will return to Europe with their new LP.

Der Trompeter, Produzent und Komponist Theo Croker ist ein Geschichtenerzähler, der durch seine Trompete spricht – dabei Grenzen überwindet und sich durch Musik Gehör verschafft.

Mit den Alben “BLK2LIFE II A Future Past“ (2021), “Love Quantum“ (2022) und der EP “By The Way“ (2023) hat er einen wichtigen Teil der Herkunft, Gegenwart und Zukunft der Black Music Culture in den USA musikalisch aufgearbeitet. Theo Croker steht damit an der Spitze einer jungen Generation an Musiker*Innen der afro-amerikanischen Jazz-Szene, die das musikalische Erbe und die prägenden kulturellen Leistungen ihrer Vorgänger neu beleuchtet, deren Beitrag für die US-amerikanische Musikentwicklung historisch selbstbewusst aufarbeitet und traditionelle Genre-Grenzen hinter sich lässt.

Gospel, Blues, Jazz, Soul, Funk: Theo Croker hebt die musikhistorischen Gemeinsamkeiten all dieser Genres hervor und verwandelt sie in einen neuen, zeitgemäßen Sound. Auf einer Metaebene sind diese Strömungen für ihn in der positiven Gestaltungskraft der Liebe verbunden, die es ermöglicht, gegen alle Widerstände neue Erlebniswelten und Realitäten zu schaffen: „Love Quantum ist auch eine Hommage an all die verschiedenen Ebenen der Liebe, die es geben kann - Liebe zu einem Freund, Liebe zu einem Partner, Liebe zu einem Elternteil, Liebe zu sich selbst und Liebe zum Leben. Es geht darum, wie mächtig diese Energie für uns als Menschen ist.“

Eröffnet wird der Abend von Brekky Boy. Das Electro-Psychedelic-Jazz-Trio aus Sydney spielt am liebsten in Jazz-Bars und auf Berggipfeln. Mit Einflüssen von Künstler*innen wie Tigran Hamasyan, GoGo Penguin, Robert Glasper und Phronesis hat das Ensemble einen lebendigen, originellen Sound entwickelt, der Elemente aus Jazz, Rock, Minimal und Folk enthält. Mit ihren mitreißenden Live-Shows gehören Brekky Boy zu den aufregendsten jungen Acts der australischen Jazz- und Instrumentalszene. Ihren ursprünglichen Traum, in der World Surf League anzutreten, haben die am Strand von Sydney lebenden Musiker aufgegeben, dafür wurden sie für den Montreux Jazz Award nominiert, haben Bands wie Snarky Puppy supportet und auf zahlreichen internationalen Jazzfestivals gespielt. Das Trio ist bis heute völlig unabhängig geblieben und hat 2023 seine vierte EP 'Seita' veröffentlicht.

Theo Croker is a storyteller who speaks through his trumpet. A creative who refuses boundaries, the GRAMMY Award-nominated artist, composer, producer, thought leader, and influencer projects his voice through the music.

With the albums ""BLK2LIFE II A Future Past"" (2021), ""Love Quantum"" (2022) and the EP ""By The Way"" (2023) he has musically reappraised an important part of the origin, present and future of black music culture in the USA. Theo Croker is at the forefront of a young generation of African-American jazz musicians who are shedding new light on the musical legacy and formative cultural achievements of their predecessors, confidently reassessing their contribution to the development of US music and leaving traditional genre boundaries behind.

Gospel, blues, jazz, soul, funk: Theo Croker emphasises the musical-historical similarities of all these genres and transforms them into a new, contemporary sound. On a meta level, he connects these trends with the positive creative power of love, which makes it possible to create new worlds of experience and realities against all odds: ""Love Quantum is also a tribute to all the different levels of love that can exist - love for a friend, love for a partner, love for a parent, love for yourself and love for life. It's about how powerful this energy is for us as human beings.”

The evening will be opened by Brekky Boy. The electro-psychedelic jazz trio from Sydney prefers to play in jazz bars and on mountain peaks. With influences from artists such as Tigran Hamasyan, GoGo Penguin, Robert Glasper and Phronesis, the ensemble has developed a vibrant, original sound that incorporates elements of jazz, rock, minimal and folk. Brekky Boy are one of the most exciting young acts on the Australian jazz and instrumental scene. Having given up their original dream of competing in the World Surf League, the Sydney beach-based musicians have been nominated for the Montreux Jazz Award, supported bands such as Snarky Puppy and played at numerous international jazz festivals. The trio has remained completely independent to this day and released their fourth EP ‘Seita’ in 2023.

grooves and no shortage of Aussie humour…” - Jazzwise

Jeden Dienstag ab 18:00 Uhr. Seit inzwischen mehr als 10 Jahren ist der Dienstag mit ""Open Decks & Tischtennis"" im Humboldthain Club eine feste Instanz für Nordberliner Bewegungsjunkies. 

Ob die Platten zum Auflegen, die Kellen fürs Tischtennis oder die Ballerinas für den Floor – jeden Dienstag könnt ihr euer Spielzeug mitbringen und vom Wochenende entschlacken. 
Ob Techno, Drum and Bass, Disco oder Mamas Schlagersammlung – jeder Stil ist willkommen und wird vom Publikum abgefeiert. 

Daher bietet der ""Open Decks Abend"" vielen jungen DJs eine nach wie vor einzigartige Plattform zur Darbietung ihrer Künste und zum Austausch untereinander. 

Zwei Tischtennisplatten, genug Kellen für alle, ein Kickertisch, satter Sound aus den Boxen und nicht zuletzt leckeres Bier vom Fass, tragen dazu bei, dass eine stetig wachsende Zahl an gut gelaunten Menschen den Dienstag im Humboldthain Club zu ihrer Homebase erklärt hat. 

FAQ Frage: Wie läuft das mit dem Auflegen? 
Antwort: Zu Beginn jeder Veranstaltung liegt an der Mainbar eine Liste mit den DJ-Slots für den Abend aus. 

Jeder Slot geht eine halbe Stunde und jeder DJ darf nur einen (seinen) Namen in die Liste eintragen.

Kazy Lambist alias Arthur Dubreucq beweist, dass der so genannte French Touch in der elektronischen Musik nach wie vor lebendig ist und Bedeutendes hervorbringt. Seine Musik ist schwebend und verträumt, sinnlich und voller Emotionen. Einige sagen Chill-Wave dazu und das bedeutet, dass sich hinter einer vordergründigen Eingängigkeit eine lebendige und tanzbare Melancholie verbirgt: raffiniert und hedonistisch, flüchtig und elegant, entspannt und charaktervoll.

Nach einer Reihe von Singles und EPs und einer ausgedehnten internationalen Tournee schlägt Kaziy Lambist nun das zweite Kapitel auf und präsentiert sein neues Album „Moda“, benannt nach dem Istanbuler Künstler*innenviertel auf der asiatischen Seite des Bosporus. Hier hat er eine Zeit lang gelebt und gemeinsam mit Sedef Sebüktekin den Song “Dünya"" aufgenommen. Darüber hinaus entstand “Moda Disko“ (in Zusammenarbeit mit Den Ze), eine mitreißende Italo-Disco-Kollaboration, die sich der vibrierenden Lebendigkeit dieses Viertels widmet. Geografisch ist das Album sehr weit gefasst und bezieht seine Inspiration aus der Türkei, Italien und Südfrankreich. “Moda“ verwebt nahtlos elektronische und organische Klänge und strebt sowohl nach klanglicher Ekstase als auch nach introspektiver Traurigkeit.

Kazy Lambist brilliert in verschiedenen Stimmungen und Geschwindigkeiten. Seine Musik lädt gleichermaßen zum Tagträumen in der Hängematte, zum Tanzen in einer gemütlichen Lounge oder auf einem hypnotischen, sonnengeküssten Dancefloor ein.

_____________________________________________



KAZY LAMBIST 
NEW ALBUM / « MODA »
Kazy Lambist persistently navigates the realm of his friction-less, conflict-free sounds with a music both welcoming and panoramic, sophisticated and hedonistic, volatile and elegant, relaxed yet full of character. While others might resort to using their electronic arsenal for more aggressive means, Kazy Lambist, inspired by sensuality and emotions, refuses to confine himself to certain restricted musical niches. Not surprising for an artist who’s been striving to push boundaries since his early days, looking to offer an extensive vision to his audience, inviting listeners to daydream in their hammock, dance away in a cosy lounge or on a hypnotic sun-kissed dance-floor. His first viral hit “Doing Yoga”, had earned him the new talent Inrocks Lab audience award in 2015, film director Guillermo Del Toro’s enthusiastic endorsement and led to a collaboration with fashion designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac. Subsequently, he released the stellar breakthrough album 33 000 Ft, undeniably making a name for himself on the electro-pop scene. 
Kazy Lambist is now ready to launch the second chapter, an LP almost six years in the making that shouldn’t be mistaken for the result of great artistic inertia. The fresh-faced thirty-year old still delighted us with his interim output including, the breezy Sky Kiss EP with a compelling Jean-Benoît Dunckel (Air) collaboration, breathing a new, more classic life into some of his early successes (Decrescendo EP), and a few more exploratory wanderings (‘Nasty’ together with Italian rapper Tutti Fenomeni). He also made the world dance with his live shows and Dj sets, confirming his global appeal with a platinum-certified single (‘Love Song’), five gold-certified singles (‘Doing Yoga’, ‘Headson’, ‘On You’, ‘Annecy’ and ‘Work’) and a worldwide tour bookended by a 20-concert US tour alongside fellow French outfit Kid Francescoli. Leading the international acclaim is Turkey, where his success was firmly established following a recent spat of gigs and a month-and-a-half long residence in the artistic neighborhood of Moda, located on the Asian side of the Bosphorus strait. This oriental retreat inspired the name for his new album, Moda, where Kazy Lambist - real name Arthur Dubreucq -  recorded ‘Dünya’, a seraphic effort featuring the soothing vocals of Sedef Sebüktekin over Turkish violins and Jowee Omicil’s saxophone. Similarly ‘Moda Disko’, a jubilant Italo-disco collaboration with singer Den Ze would have fitted perfectly in the soundtrack for Italian movie La Grande Bellezza.
Produced with the help of Glasses (seen on “Love Song” and “Oh My God”) with Ash Workman (Metronomy, Christine and the Queens, Baxter Dury…) officiating behind the mixing desk, the collaborative record, featuring a wealth of instrumental cameos from different background, seamlessly weaves the electronic and more organic sounds together. Geographically expansive, the album draws inspiration from Turkey, Italy (where he lived for two years during the album conception), the South of France (his native Montpellier) with the symbolic Mediterranean serving as a common thread. The album immerses itself in the limbo of a flourishing chill-wave, manifesting in various bustling forms. The album narrates tales of love, striving for both sonic ecstasy and introspective sorrow (‘After All’), a combination that oozes enough suave (‘Italian Way’) and golden reflections (‘Somebody To Love’), to shine at variable speeds and better suit the listener’s mood. This fluid type of pop (‘Nirvana’ featuring Californian singer Julietta) adorns more voluptuously solar highlights to express the disintegration of the relationship between an artist and his muse (‘Lost’ with longtime stage collaborator Amouë), or becomes more restless in the immoderate elation of wine celebration (‘Méditerranée’). The music also takes on a groovy sensuality on ‘Flawless Form’, accompanied by the Strasbourg jazz collective Emile Londonien. With Moda, Kazy Lambist explores beyond the borders, all the time preserving a perfect balance between refinement and pleasure.

Ziv Ravitz & Federico Casagrande, , Sean Steinfeger (Opening DJ-Set/D)",18,Jazz,"Der Akkordeonist Vincent Peirani gilt als einer der kreativsten Musiker der europäischen Jazzszene und betritt mit seinem Instrument immer wieder neue Wege – virtuos und überraschend. Mit seinem Projekt Jokers wendet er sich dem klassischen Format des Jazztrios zu, um mit dessen Konventionen gleich wieder zu brechen. Seine beiden Mitstreiter, Federico Casagrande an der Gitarre und Ziv Ravitz an Schlagzeug und Keyboards, verfügen beide über einen reichen Erfahrungsschatz, ein Interesse an Rock und elektronischer Musik und eine Vorliebe für musikalische Hybridität. Ob Solist, Rhythmiker, Akzentuierer, Farbgeber oder vieles mehr: Die Idee hinter dieser Besetzung ist das spontane Wechselspiel der musikalischen Rollen untereinander. Gemeinsam taucht das Trio mit der Freiheit des Jazz in eine cineastische und üppige Klangwelt ein, die ebenso überrascht wie verzaubert. Ein fantasievolles Jazz-Fusion-Rock-Electronica-Abenteuer mit Spannung, Poesie, Rhythmus, virtuosen Ausbrüchen und intimen Momenten.

Wir empfehlen zur Einstimmung das gleichnamige Album, das neben sehr persönlichen und eigenständigen Coverversionen von Marilyn Manson, Bishop Briggs oder den Nine Inch Nails auch Eigenkompositionen, vor allem von Peirani selbst, enthält. Trotz aller Einflüsse aus anderen Genres ist Jokers letztlich ein klares Jazzprojekt: Im Mittelpunkt steht die Interaktion. Die drei Musiker hören einander zu, kommunizieren und erwecken so das Ausgangsmaterial zum Leben. Und sie wandeln auf verschlungenen Pfaden, die erst im Moment des Zusammenspiels entstehen und sich immer wieder neu verzweigen.

In Kindheit und Jugend zunächst klassisch ausgebildet, entdeckte Vincent Peirani mit 16 Jahren den Jazz für sich und studierte später am Pariser Konservatorium - dem einzigen in Frankreich, dessen Jazzabteilung Akkordeonisten aufnahm. Seitdem hat er die Sprache des Akkordeons mit seinem Gespür für Stilkreuzungen und ungewöhnliche Klangfarben grundlegend erneuert. Als lupenreiner Jazzmusiker, dem aber auch Weltmusik, Klassik, Chanson oder Pop leicht von der Hand gehen, engagiert er sich in verschiedenen Projekten, denen er mit seinem dynamischen und innovativen Spiel einen besonderen Zauber verleiht.

Für diese Veranstaltung bieten wir ermäßigte Tickets an, um auch Menschen mit kleinerem Portmonee Zugang zu Kultur zu ermöglichen. Diese Kontingente sind limitiert und nur bei TixforGigs verfügbar. Wir vertrauen auf Eure Selbsteinschätzung: Wenn ihr könnt, bucht Standard-Tickets und überlasst die ermäßigten Kontingente denjenigen, die gerade sehr sparen müssen.

The Expeditions series was founded in spring 2018 with a clear vision of breaking out of the monotony that defines most pure Techno nights in Berlin. The concept is to create a clear musical distinction between the different parts of the night, while remaining loyal to the classical and traditional aspects of Techno: from Detroit groove to hypnotic and atmospheric storytelling. We emphasize energy and progression. We strive to create a clear beginning and a decisive end. We believe in Techno as a journey, designed for the dance floor, rather than for podcasts. Following this principle, we curate the second floor with classic, warm, chord-led interpretations of House music, that serve as a perfect contrast to the main floor program. Occasionally, you might even find a third floor hidden in the vast garden of :// about blank. Explore, that's what the Expeditions is about.

▆  What to expect
⦿ A Power Deck with well curated interpretations of pure Techno music. No minimalism, no sophisticated preaching. 
⦿ A Comfort Deck with a contrasting program, curated with the finest House music: classic Chicago House, Soulful and New York Garage, and Berlin contemporary touches.
⦿ DJs at eye level, musically educated audience and Berlin underground at its best. 

▆ FAQ
 ⦿ Is there a dress-code? - No, the Expeditions doesn't have a dress code, but we do encourage you to be creative when choosing an outfit for the party., and to leave your everyday behind.
⦿ Is taking photos inside the club allowed?
- No. The Expeditions, and :// about blank have a strict no-photo policy. We also strongly encourage you to check in your phone at the cloakroom and lose the feeling of time. This is, however, not mandatory.⦿ Is the Expeditions a safe space for minority groups?
- The Expeditions, and :// about blank in general, are a safe space for any ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. Any sign of racism, sexism, antisemitism, or homophobia will not be tolerated.

.
/// KLUB RULES
Important. If you have not fully processed + understood our Klub Rules, we cannot let you enter. We expect you to explain our Klub Rules at any given point.
--> klubverboten[dot]com/rules
.

/// BECOME A MEMBER
Our spaces are laboratories for modern BDSM + Fetish culture. Thus, safeguarding is at the core of everything we do to enable freedoms and complexities of play that sadly do not often find understanding in the world outside these walls. Klub Verboten Members are the most caring and perverted people around; in return, members benefit from the following goodies:

+ FAST TRACK QUEUE
+ NO DOOR VETTING
+ MEMBERS ONLY PLAY SPACE (LDN)
+ ADMISSION TO MEMBERS + FRIENDS EVENTS
+ % EARLY BIRD TICKETS (BER + LDN)
+ % TICKETS FOR TEARS FOR BEERS
+ ACCESS TO THE NUDES GALLERY

/// HOW TO GET INTO KLUB VERBOTEN
Everyone is subject to a vetting procedure at some stage to ensure relative safety + ultraperverions. There are three routes to attend our main event in London + Berlin:

I. [BECOME A MEMBER ONLINE]
II. [GET VETTED IN PERSON AT TEARS FOR BEERS]
III. [BUY A TICKET + GET VETTED EACH TIME YOU ENTER THE MAIN EVENT*]

*Non-members can purchase tickets and come to our doors. But are subject to door vetting: We may have to refuse your entry + refund your ticket if we do not feel comfortable yet letting you enter such a fragile dollop of human complexities. Only approved members can bypass our door vetting teams. Non-members will need to get vetted at each new event again and thus queue for longer.

/// DRESS CODE
Klub Verboten is a fetish club with a strict dress code policy. If you are inexperienced, stick to these: Latex, Rubber, PVC, Leather, Metal or Lace. Your outfit does not need to be expensive; creativity & authentic expression are essential. That rigorously thought-through piece of rubber may be the enabler to a dialogue leading to a later radical and hard-loving friendship. If your outfit is not Klub Verboten enough, we cannot let you enter. If one could wear it in a cocktail bar, you can't wear it at a fet1sh club. Safeguarding our cumunity is paramount; therefore, we may refuse entry to anyone whose outfit communicates a lack of understanding required to navigate these spaces. We cannot give feedback on individual outfits before the event. Yes, you can get changed at the venue, and there is a cloakroom. More details:
--> klubverboten[dot]com/dress-code

/// TICKET RETURNS / WAITLIST
Once an event sells out, the ticket return option becomes available & tickets will be offered to people on the waitlist. Ticket transfers outside the Dice platform are not permitted for safeguarding purposes. Screen shots aren't real tickets and will be refused Klub Verboten does not provide refunds.

/// HELP
Sadly we get more messages here than any generic pervert could handle in a day without wrecking their mental health. Therefore we can no longer offer any naughty chat support. Nevertheless, you can find all answers to your questions on our website. The help section is growing daily and is the most extensive kinkspace FAQs library around.

--> For all questions about ticketing, please visit dice[dot]fm/contact

/// PHOTO VIDEO AUDIO RECORDING POLICY
We strictly do not permit any photo, video or audio recording.
However, our trusted in-house photographers may take photos, videos, and/or audio recordings. By purchasing a ticket / entering our events, you agree to your picture and/or your audio/video recording possibly being taken and used by Klub Verboten for promotional and/or commercial purposes. If you want to avoid having your photo or video taken, please tell our photo or videographers during the event.

/// IMPORTANT
A ticket alone does not entitle you to enter the event. Klub Verboten is a fetish & BDSM cummunity & members club. A place for modern human interaction. If you do not fully understand why comprehending and adhering to all of our Klub Rules is of ultra importance at all times, then this space is not for you. We have no mercy for consent violators, personal space invaders, toxic masculinity, perpetrators of sexual assault, dating app zorros and so on. You can demonstrate that you gained sufficient in-depth knowledge in navigating Klub Verboten's BDSM & fetish playspaces by becoming a member via our website or being vetted at our social event, Tears For Beers. Alternatively, you can get vetted every time again at our doors at risk of being turned away. If you've been previously kicked out from our event and issued a ban, you will be refused entry for life and not receive a refund if you decide to buy a ticket. Please respect us in safeguarding our cummunity.

/// T&C’s
You agree to our Klub Rules by submitting the application form and/or ticket purchase. Failure to comply leads to ejection from the event and a potential lifetime ban and termination of membership. Members are responsible for their friends and partners and for the entire cummunity. Klub Membership or holding a ticket does not guarantee that you will be permitted entry to the event on the night. Our door staff reserve the right to refuse any ticket holders' admission at their absolute discretion. Reasons for non-admission may include (but are not limited to) our door staff having a genuinely held belief that a ticket holder has: not complying with the dress code, been denied or had their suspended membership suspended, not yet been granted membership but cannot demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the Klub Rules when asked, been ejected from one of our events, been the subject of a behavioural complaint at a previous or similar event, been disrespectful to our staff or other guests, is overly intoxicated, otherwise demonstrated that they present a risk to our community or licencing conditions. In such cases, we will endeavour to provide a refund of the ticket price within 30 days of the event, except in cases where there has been a clear failure to adhere to the dress code or where a person has previously had their membership rejected or suspended. We endeavour to provide reasons for non-admission where it is practical to do so. If a ticket holder is denied entry but decides to rejoin the queue or cheat their way into our event by any other means, the refund will be revoked and a lifetime ban issued. If a patron is denied entry and other ticket holders in their company decide not to enter, no refund can be issued to the ticket holders who voluntarily decided not to enter. Further, no refunds can be issued to patrons who we are forced to remove from the premises.

AN(8)X is a Berlin-based artist group curating hybrid art events with a focus on audiovisual performances that spotlight queer, FLINTA artists with ESEA backgrounds. Focused on radical experimentation and community, they showcase the raw, hyper-regional sound of East and Southeast Asia's underground scene.

KUDUR is a Berlin-based collective and party series led by trans/queer BIPOC members, focused on creating safer spaces for community and artistic expression. Inspired by the Mediterranean's rich history, Kudur crosses genre, border, and generational boundaries, blending music, culture, and politics while preserving its members' cultural roots and challenging social norms.

KWIA is a no-longer-secret, ambient-focused listening bar situated along Berlin's Maybachufer that follows in the tradition of Japanese jazz kissas —bars with high-end sound systems for attentive listening. Bringing this rare audio culture to Berlin, KWIA offers a queer, musically open space featuring contemplative electronic music.",Future-east,"https://futureeast-festival.com/, https://www.instagram.com/future.east_berlin/"

Eyes closed on a journey to your own emotions. The melodies change the rhythm of your heartbeat, while you silently listen to every word sung. It feels like we are all connected and it’s so obviously honest, real, and it’s earnest…

With their performances, teepee aims to create a welcoming and safer space, a parallel world where you can stop for a moment and let go. It is a space where any sign of difference is embraced, a place to observe the wonders buried deep within you. Soulful vocal harmonies and captivating melodies help capture the magic between Tereza Lavičková and Miroslav Patočka, who formed the dream-pop project teepee in 2015 and have been exploring the space between electric and acoustic elements ever since. Subtle samples and synthetic sounds provide a bed for their melancholic, honest and confessional lyrics. Over time, they have enriched their original sound which is rooted in indie-folk with more electronic and pop elements, highlighted by the involvement of new live musicians.

teepee is a pretty well established band from the Czech Republic with three released studio albums and over 1 million streams on Spotify. They have also played numerous shows throughout Europe and at some major showcase festivals such as Eurosonic Noorderslag, Enea Spring Break, Waves Vienna and Reeperbahn Festival. Right before the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the band played their biggest European tour in support of the British duo Seafret which also included a sold out show in Berlin.

◈ What to expect? ◈

These worlds are connected through the Liminal Space, a surreal realm where different realities collide and glitch together, resulting in bizarre performances of roaming creatures.

◈ FAQ ◈
> Is there a dress code?
The usual Kater Blau door policy applies. However, we encourage you to bring a character to the event to become a part of it.

> Why the secret music lineup?
Join for the experience and not for a single headliner. Since DJs have enough spotlight in the club environment, we decided to refocus attention on art collectives, performers, storylines, and the awareness concept. Here are some key facts about the musical program:
● Every floor = different music: technoid, bouncy-dirty, and slow. 
● Gender-balanced lineup.
● Artists are allowed to post, so if you dig a bit you will find out. 

> Why the Awareness Team?
We are trying to create an equalizing space, in which it does not matter who you are. A space where you can get a brief rest from the overregulated outside world and experience connection and play while your boundaries are respected. As much as we want to believe in this utopia, we know such an environment can be exploited. The awareness team is a low-barrier touchpoint for you if you experience any form of boundary crossing or discrimination. They are here to listen, take you out of the situation, and assist you if you are unwell.

In cooperation with the feminist electronic music festival Heroines of Sound, Volksbühne presents exciting audio-visual live sets by Valentina Magaletti & Theresa Baumgartner, Noémi Büchi and Ukrainian electronica whiz Zavoloka, in a cooperation with the feminist electronic music festival Heroines of Sound . Expect a multifaceted spectrum of immersive drones, straddling noise avant-garde, field recordings, experimental pop and visual media. Electronic music as symphonic maximalist mix – inspired by the embodiment of sound.

Valentina Magalotti & Theresa Baumgartner: LUCHA LIBRE

Friction loss, glitch, clash - drummer Valentina Magaletti’s compositions for drums and percussive instruments adopt a very inventive approach. On LUCHA LIBRE, she showcases the wildest variations of her versatile techniques exploring technoid sound art in dungeon sound volume, textural rhythms and the amazing potential of consonance and dissonance. Complex, non-linear time situations oscillating within a rhythmical continuum between simple structures, poly-rhythmic overlays and pure chaos, are translated into a dazzling AV show by Theresa Baumgartner in this Berlin debut.

Noémi Büchi: DOES IT STILL MATTER 

Noémi Büchi’s AV set Does It Still Matter will be a German premiere, on show in Berlin for the first time. The music is an exquisite mix of textural drones and delicate yet complex rhythms. Hypnotic cluster compositions made of film music, sound sculptures, classical music fragments and jazzy patches are combined to productively clash in a symphony of sound textures.  Does It Still Matter rounds off a series of previous releases comprising Matière and Matter, all focusing on the embodiment of sound and the physicality of music. Büchi’s sound structures and aesthetic choices are exploring the idea of materiality in an increasingly liquid, fluid, immaterial world.

Zavoloka

Kateryna Zavoloka, sound and media artist, composer and performer from Ukraine, is uncompromisingly devoted to leftfield music free from genre expectations and stylistic requirements. She will present her latest tracks in an elaborate audio-visual set created by the artist herself. Experimental electronic music peppered with references to Ukrainian folk music, and club music combined with analogue instrument use are her speciality, and very accessible at that. Traditional music instruments like the kobza, a Ukrainian guitar, and spilka and kolianka flutes allude to folk songs from Ukraine to soon get lost in an imaginary distance, which adds an almost meditative touch. The focus is on forward-pushing electronic beats that are at once dynamic and lingering. Her last album Amulet was nominated for “best album of the year” in 2022 by various music magazines. Kateryna Zavoloka lives in Berlin.",VolksbuehneBerlin,"https://www.volksbuehne.berlin/#/en/repertoire/valentina-magaletti-theresa-baumgartner-noemi-buechi-zavoloka, https://ticket.volksbuehne-berlin.de/eventim.webshop/webticket/seatmap?eventId=22110"

Fünf ausgewählte Termine in München, Zürich, Wien, Hamburg und Berlin sind geplant. Der exklusive Presale startet ab sofort im Ticketshop: undercover.de. Verboten Berlin ist bekannt für die Verschmelzung von elektronischen Neo-Kraut-Elementen mit den vielfältigen musikalischen Einflüssen der Berliner Clubkultur. Musiker und Produzent Alexander Freund, der kreative Kopf hinter dem Projekt, gießt darin seine Leidenschaft für das Komponieren und Songwriting in innovative Songs. Die Tracks von Verboten Berlin wurden bereits von Künstlern wie Booka Shade, Rodriguez Jr., Tube & Berger und Monkey Safari geremixt und gesungen und haben es in renommierten Editorial-Playlists wie Low Key Tech und New Music Friday geschafft. Das Ergebnis ist eine stetig wachsende Anhängerschaft.

2024 zieht es Verboten Berlin wieder auf die Bühne. Einige ausgewählte Clubshows sind geplant – neben Deutschland stehen auch Österreich und die Schweiz auf dem Tourplan. Verboten Berlin-Konzerte sind dabei alles andere als gewöhnlich. „Für mich bedeutet Freiheit, dass keiner oben oder unten steht, dass wir uns auf Augenhöhe begegnen – und das verfolge ich auf Tour und mit dem Album,“ betont Alexander Freund. „Ich möchte nicht der Ansager sein, nicht die Gefühle anleiten und das Publikum an die Hand nehmen. Ich möchte, dass wir das gemeinsam machen […]“ Das neue Album „Mountains Of Glass“ sieht Freund dabei, ebenso wie die vorherigen Veröffentlichungen, lediglich als Rahmen. „Besonders freue ich mich darauf, jeden Abend mit einem neuen Track, Beat oder Song von der Bühne zu kommen, entstanden in gemeinsamen Momenten, spontan.“",FWhahn,"https://tickets.undercover.de/verboten-berlin-tickets?affiliate=%20residentadvisor, https://www.instagram.com/verbotenberlin/?hl=de, https://open.spotify.com/intl-de/artist/6RNhl0w2Lfem0Xjy3l0LKX?si=v0VF-yBjRcqgU9iBIiQ7bw"

The popular maxim “see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil” doesn’t have a universal meaning. In some languages the expression denotes choosing to ignore the harmful actions of another, in others it warns against doing the wrong thing yourself. 3hd’s “See No Evil” evening of performances at HAU Hebbel am Ufer, not only explores these differing-though-related interpretations of social agency and responsibility, but also its definition in relation to existing norms and conventions.

Perspective, interpretation, and projection are some of the psychological themes that haunt the work of Cristine Brache and Sigrid Lauren’s “Goodnight Sweet Thing.” The forty-minute live performance art piece unfolds over three Acts, beginning with a deconstructed Jello wrestling match between protagonists Mary Magdalene and Nothing Girl—two parts of the same mind in literal and psychic conflict—before the scene transforms into a Victorian psychoanalysis session and then crescendos with a 1950s American prom motif. Adapted from Brache's poetry collection of the same name, the performance intertwines poetry, movement, and a score by Ryan Woodhall, to explore the internal battle for authenticity, and examines its complex relationship with societal pressures and authority.

While “Goodnight Sweet Thing” reflects on the complexities of masking and societal performance via overlapping historical time periods, customs, and traditions, Damsel Elysium envisions an alternative world altogether. The multi-instrumentalist, composer, and interdisciplinary artist creates an expressive realm outside language. Damsel draws on their recent Whispers From Ancient Vessels release on AD 93 to enact a collection of tales and “speakings” in immersive live performances that unite sound, plants, and ritual.

𝙋𝙪𝙗𝙡𝙞𝙘 𝘿𝙞𝙨𝙥𝙡𝙖𝙮 𝙊𝙛 𝘼𝙛𝙛𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣
An international band of art punk, provocative indie music. Renowned for their live raucous shows, cinematic visual art & a wild arrangement of styles.
Explosive femme vocals with lyricist & dancer Madeleine Rose, tracks co-produced by Anton Remy, drummer and multi-instrumentalist. Their upcoming Double Album 'Expressions Of Obsessions’ was recorded with both new collaborators and previous members of P.D.O.A.

Playing their part in keeping Germany’s capital weird, P.D.O.A.’s live shows hark back to the fearless eccentricity explored by the West Berlin performance art and music collectives of the 1980’s. P.D.O.A. is an act of near zen-like non duality, hittin’ that golden ratio between the soulful and the sinful.

𝙇𝙚𝙢𝙤𝙣𝙜𝙧𝙖𝙗
Originally hailing from Montreal, core duo Léonie Dishaw and Gaëlle Cordeau relocated to Berlin in 2019, and with the move came a fresh start for Lemongrab. Locking in the drummer of Leipzig synth-punks Lassie, Teun Verheij, along with Fritz Ali Hansen on bass and Joel Thomas on guitar, the band has made a quick yet lasting impression in the Berlin and German punk scenes. Fans of Devo, The Raincoats, Wire, and Delta 5 will love this.

Advance tickets are available on our website or at the INSOMNIA cloakroom. 

INSOMNIA is THE sex-positive hotspot and safe space for hedonists, sexual free spirits, BDSM and fetish lovers, and the queer community.

At Venus 2024, we will once again be presenting ourselves with our own booth, the INSOMNIA Lounge, kinky shows and extraordinary party nights in the club after the fair.

Together with Joyclub Sex Education, we are once again setting a few feminist accents this year against the male-dominated program at the fair – sex coaches and modern sex-positive relationship therapists invite you to lectures and stimulating discussions in our INSOMNIA Lounge in Hall 18. But of course the shows won't be neglected either.

At our booth at the Venus trade fair, you can not only have a friendly chat with Dominique and other personalities from INSONIA, but you can also have yourself professionally photographed with your favorite star or starlet by our in-house photographer in a photo corner. A sex coaching area, where tantra specialists and sex therapists inform you about sexual wellness and alternative forms of love and relationships, completes our exciting ensemble.

Every half hour, you can listen to interesting lectures while enjoying a relaxing drink at the specially designed INSOMNIA bar.

Enjoy the days with us at Venus and when the gates close under the radio tower, we will roll out the red carpet at INSOMNIA for international guests and, of course, stars and starlets from the scene.

On Friday, October 25th, from 10:00 p.m., we look forward to the “Venus Kick Off” party with DJs Monty & Forbidden Kitten and driving techno beats. A breathtakingly indecent show “Vikings” by the enchanting Brittany Bardot awaits you around midnight.

On Saturday, October 26th, from 10 p.m., “Venus Bizarre” will follow – the fetish party and sex-positive hotspot for all night owls. Here you can let yourself go after the day at the fair, try out the newly purchased fetish outfit, dance to the electronic beats of our techno-house-psytrance DJs Anubix & DonDilone and be enchanted by a particularly obscene performance by DoubleTrouble Berlin.

In addition to the party activities, our BDSM catacombs in the basement, the separate playrooms, couple area, clinic area, massage and whirlpool invite you to indulge in forbidden games and sinful activities.

Our attentive awareness team will take care of you and your safe space and is always approachable.

Admission on Friday or Saturday:
€30 per person, €27 in advance 

Combined ticket for Friday and Saturday:
55€ per person, 50€ presale 

Tickets are also available at the box office at the club or at the INSOMNIA stand at the Venus trade show. It is recommended that you purchase tickets in advance.


Rules of the evening:

Our awareness team will be in the club and is always available to talk to.

No means no.

Do you want to talk to someone, dance or play? Ask politely if they are interested and respect their answer.

Leave others their space when they are playing with each other or being intimate. Do you want to join in? Ask politely and respect their answer.

""No single word in English renders all the shades of TOSKA. At its deepest and most painful, it is a sensation of great spiritual anguish, often without any specific cause. At less morbid levels it is a dull ache of the soul, a longing with nothing to long for, a sick pining, a vague restlessness, mental throes, yearning. In particular cases it may be the desire for somebody of something specific, nostalgia, love-sickness. At the lowest level it grades into ennui, boredom.” - Vladimir Nabokov",projektbau,https://linktr.ee/projektbau

Berghain-Premiere für Grace Dahl, DJ, Produzentin und Labelbetreiberin (Serial Disc Touchers) mit finnisch-ungarischen Wurzeln. Als Resident-DJ der Vault Sessions ist sie für ihre vielseitigen Techno-Sets, treibenden Grooves und kraftvollen Kickdrums bekannt. Mandel, der auf Refuge Worldwide eine eigene Radiosendung namens House of Highlife hat, legt ebenfalls zum ersten Mal bei uns auf.

It's no overstatement to call him the voice of house music, instantly recognizable to anyone who's ever been remotely near a dancefloor: Robert Owens. His Chicago house-torch songs “Bring Down The Walls” and “Can You Feel It”, recorded with Larry Heard in the second half of the 80s, and “I'll Be Your Friend”, which he wrote with Satoshi Tomiie in 1991, made him a legend. Since then, Owens has lent his charismatic voice to countless records by acts such as Masters At Work, Photek and, most recently, Luke Slater and his project LB Dub Corp. Robert Owens will be playing at Panorama Bar for this edition of Klubnacht, and Slater will be playing live in the Säule with his house project. Berghain debut for Grace Dahl, DJ/producer and label owner (Serial Disc Touchers) with Finnish-Hungarian roots. As resident DJ of Vault Sessions, she's known for her versatile techno sets, propulsive grooves and powerful kick drums. Also playing here for the first time is Mandel, who has his own radio show called House of Highlife on Refuge Worldwide.",Ostgut,https://www.berghain.berlin/de/event/77234/

Ihr Vorhaben: Das Repertoire einer Brass Band mit einer Melange aus Big Band Swing, Hip-Hop Grooves, Disco und House Klängen neu aufzustellen. Gallowstreet nutzen diese breite Palette musikalischer Genres, um mit ihren Kompositionen Geschichten zu erzählen, die meisten davon beatgetrieben, alle von hymnischer Qualität. Ihre Bühnenshows sind phänomenal, denn mit ihrer unerbittlichen Rhythmik erzeugen sie einen Sog, der die Intensität eines erstklassigen DJ-Sets locker erreicht.

Inzwischen ist die Band seit über zehn Jahren mit ihrer avantgardistischen Blechblasmusik unterwegs und hat sich zu einer großen Inspirationsquelle für die junge, aufstrebende europäische Brass Band Szene entwickelt. Es vergeht keine Woche, in der nicht ein Gallowstreet Song von jungen, begeisterten Brass Bands neu arrangiert und gecovert wird.

Mit ihrem jüngsten Album “A Trip Worth Making“ reflektiert die Gallowstreet-Crew ihre gemeinsame Reise und lässt die Herausforderungen, Chancen und Feiern Revue passieren, die sie auf diesem Weg sowohl als Gruppe als auch als einzelne Musiker erlebt haben. Es ist ein Höhepunkt des Sounds, den sie im Laufe der Jahre entwickelt haben, indem sie mitsingbare Hymnen, intelligent orchestrierte Drops und Builds sowie emotionsgeladene Riffs effektiv zu einem Album zusammenfügen, das einige der härtesten Bläsersätze liefert, die die Welt je gehört hat.

Für diese Veranstaltung bieten wir ermäßigte Tickets an, um auch Menschen mit kleinerem Portmonee Zugang zu Kultur zu ermöglichen. Diese Kontingente sind limitiert und nur bei TixforGigs verfügbar. Wir vertrauen auf Eure Selbsteinschätzung: Wenn ihr könnt, bucht Standard-Tickets und überlasst die ermäßigten Kontingente denjenigen, die gerade sehr sparen müssen.

__________________________________________


Gallowstreet, the Dutch brass band with an attitude. Hailing from the Galgenstraat in Amsterdam they have refined their sound through the course of 4 albums.

A decade of innovating brass music. Gallowstreet has been up and at it. This squad of dedicated musicians from Amster­dam has been proving its worth at festivals and clubs both in the Netherlands and abroad. Armed with 7 horn players and 1 drummer the band employs a wide range of musical genres to tell stories with their compositions, most of them beat driven, all of them with anthemic quality.

Gallowstreet has proven to be a big inspiration for the emerging European Brass Band scene. A reference point for musicians that look to the band for inspiration. There’s no week that goes by without a video of one of the songs being covered by young enthusiastic brass bands from around the globe. Their songs have seen re-arrangements for a wide range of ensembles and Gallowstreet has been a consistent source of inspiration for other bands.  

With “A Trip Worth Making” the Gallowstreet crew reflects on their communal journey and revisits the challenges, oppor­tunities and celebrations they’ve had along the way, both as a group and as individual musicians. It is a culmination of the sound they’ve developed throughout the years, effectively using ready-to-sing along anthems, intelligently orchestrated drops and builds and emotionally laden riffs to build an album that delivers some of the heaviest brass music the world has ever heard. With shows on Lowlands, North Sea Jazz, Bout Du Monde, in Algeria, Slowakia and Turkey and sold out clubshows in the famous Paradiso in Amsterdam and the legendary New Morning in Paris the band is a well-traveled, seasoned ensemble that knows the crack of the whip when it comes to playing big shows for large crowds.

For this event we offer discounted tickets to give people with less money still access to culture. These quotas are limited and only available at TixforGigs. We trust in your self-assessment: If you can, please book standard tickets and leave the reduced tickets to those who have to save money at the moment.

Its foolish desires encompass every choreography; each dance, a performance of chaos. By invoking chaos magick, we call upon ourselves all kinds of forces; those that bring liberation and joy and those that could potentially harm or paralyze us.

If our boundaries aren't firm, we risk giving up too much of our personal power. Like elements called upon when casting a circle, think of your boundaries as the forces you conjure to protect yourself by blocking out unwanted influences.

Recall: When did someone last cross the line with you? 

Define: What are the absolute limits that others can’t cross without consequences?

Assert: Take these boundary definitions and turn them into affirmations.

As a form of reversal magic, this spell moves the energy of the boundary from being dependent on the actions of others to affirming your own principles. It’s not so much about shifting the paradigm as it is about rewiring the paradigm from the inside. The first step is to call all your power back to you. From there, you can explore. To release the mind from habitual thinking, a stimulus may be required.

It is HIGH⛤​​​​​​5.
Let the ceremony begin.

⛤​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ We call upon the element of EARTH to bring stability and resilience.

⛤​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ We call upon the element of WATER to bring fluidity and compassion.

⛤​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ We call upon the element of FIRE to bring transformative energy that creates rather than destroy.

⛤​​​​​​​ We call upon the element of AIR to bring mental clarity and learning.

⛤​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ We call upon the element of SPIRIT in the tarot archetype of the Hierophant, the wise and mighty Mistress who shows us the ancient path that will set us free and protect us from evil forces.

Look around: you're surrounded by potential accomplices, comrades, lovers, maenads, sorceresses. Dare to glimpse new routes and states of existence. Experiment with choices and (per)versions of yourself you'd never thought possible. Wear some make-up (and not much more). Perceive and perform your power, share and submit your power and wisdom, and empower each other in return. 

Come early and stay late.

For this occasion, he invites a 60-sextet made up of Berlin scene and international guests, old and new companions, for a very special, collectively improvised birthday concert as part of the series biegungen im ausland.
In his performances, the self-taught musician uses various sound objects and unusual sound generators (small electrics) in addition to the drums. Since the late 1980s he has been playing at international festivals, as well as concerts and tours in Europe and North America. Burkhard Beins has already worked with countless musicians and composers, including Keith Rowe, Sven-Åke Johansson, Peter Niklas Wilson, Orm Finnendahl, John Tilbury, Charlemagne Palestine and Axel Dörner. He is a member of the ensembles Perlonex (with Ignaz Schick), Activity Center (with Michael Renkel), Polwechsel, The Sealed Knot, Phosphor, Trio Sowari, BBB and others.

Trio Sowari brings together three musicians who have developed a very personal approach to their instrument. Respectively based in London, Paris and Berlin, Phil Durrant, Bertrand Denzler and Burkhard Beins never cease to widen the scope of their research at the crossroads of different acoustic and electronic worlds. Beyond the rigour of their improvisations, their music is nourished by multiple influences and the countless collaborations they have with artists from all horizons. Trio Sowari thus becomes a space in perpetual mutation where different currents of experimental music meet and in which asymmetrical concretions are formed, marking out an unpredictable topography. In 2024, Trio Sowari will be celebrating its 20th year of existence. Since 2004, the trio has played at numerous international festivals and venues throughout Europe. The group will release its fourth album to mark the anniversary.",guidomoebius,http://ausland.berlin/program/series/biegungen-im-ausland

Advance tickets at the INSOMNIA cloakroom and on our website. 

The INSOMNIA is the sex-positive hotspot and safe space for hedonists, sexual free spirits, BDSM and fetish lovers, and the queer community.

At Venus 2024, we will once again be presenting our own stand, the INSOMNIA Lounge, kinky shows and extraordinary party nights in the club after the fair.

Together with Joyclub Sex Education, we are once again setting a few feminist accents this year against the male-dominated program at the fair – sex coaches and modern sex-positive relationship therapists invite you to lectures and stimulating discussions in our INSOMNIA Lounge in Hall 18. But of course the shows won't be neglected either.

At our booth at the Venus trade fair, you can not only have a friendly chat with Dominique and other personalities from INSONIA, but you can also have yourself professionally photographed with your favorite star or starlet by our in-house photographer in a photo corner. A sex coaching area, where tantra specialists and sex therapists inform you about sexual wellness and alternative forms of love and relationships, completes our exciting ensemble.

Every half hour, you can listen to interesting lectures while enjoying a relaxing drink at the specially designed INSOMNIA bar.

Enjoy the days with us at Venus and when the gates close under the radio tower, we will roll out the red carpet for international guests and, of course, stars and starlets from the scene at INSOMNIA.

On Saturday, October 26th, the “Venus Bizarre” will follow from 10:00 p.m. – the fetish party and sex-positive hotspot for all night owls. Here you can let yourself go after the day at the fair, try out your newly purchased fetish outfit, dance to the electronic beats of our techno-house-psytrance DJs Anubix & DonDilone and be enchanted by a particularly obscene performance by DoubleTrouble Berlin.

In addition to the party activities, our BDSM catacombs in the basement, the separate playrooms, couple area, clinic area, massage and whirlpool invite you to indulge in forbidden games and sinful activities.

Our attentive awareness team will take care of you and your safe space and is always approachable.

Admission on Friday or Saturday:
€30 per person, €27 in advance 

Combined ticket for Friday and Saturday:
55€ per person, 50€ presale 

Tickets are also available at the box office at the club or at the INSOMNIA stand at the Venus trade show. It is recommended that you purchase tickets in advance.


Rules of the evening:

Our awareness team will be in the club and is always available to talk to.

No means no.

Do you want to talk to someone, dance or play? Ask politely if they are interested and respect their answer.

Leave others their space when they are playing with each other or being intimate. Do you want to join in? Ask politely and respect their answer.

- Cell phones are not allowed! Leave them in the dressing room.

- Crossing boundaries will not be tolerated. Ask, a no is a no.

Their pieces are open processes that create a loss of sense of time. Arrangements reduced to the essentials and expressive singing combine to form a powerful musical whole. Something new emerges from minimalism, intensity and the Balkan singing tradition.

When Gordan's first album “Down In The Meadow” was released on Morphine Records in October 2021, it was celebrated by critics and listeners alike. In May 2024, the trio presented their second, in some respects even more radical album (“Gordan”, Glitterbeat Records). With this release, Gordan reinforces the mystique of legends and stories from the Balkan countries through controlled feedback, hypnotic bass, expressive drumming and the unique singing of Svetlana Spajic.

Gordan’s music is marked by radical reduction, seemingly endless ascension and a passion for experiments. The Serbian singer Svetlana Spajić is an internationally recognized expert on the history and practice of an extremely rich musical tradition. She knows and masters the hyperlocal singing styles of the Balkan Peninsula like no other contemporary singer. Guido Möbius plays bass and various electronic sound generators. He also uses a guitar amplifier, microphone and effects to provoke feedback that harmonizes with or rubs against the vocals. A dialogue between sound and noise, expanded or fragmented by Andi Stecher's expressive drumming. Stecher dispenses with any ornamentation and at the same time plays in a varied and concentrated manner. Together the trio forms a dynamic sound body.

Sungazer, gegründet in Brooklyn New York, besteht aus dem Bassisten und Musik-Youtuber Adam Neely und dem Schlagzeuger Shawn Crowder. Wer ihre letzte Show im Gretchen gesehen hat, weiß: Ihre Konzerte sind eine Explosion aus Fusion-Jazz, 8-Bit, Glitch und Progressive Rock. Sungazer springen in die Lücke zwischen Jazz und Electronica, bringen den Geist der Improvisation in die elektronische Musik und zaubern pure Jazzeuphorie auf die Bühne. Mit ihrer speziellen Mischung arbeiten sie im Grenzbereich zwischen Jazzimprovisation und moderner elektronischer Musikästhetik.

Sungazer gibt’s seit 2014. In der Zwischenzeit waren sie bereits mit Ghost-Note, Shubh Saran und Moon Hooch auf Tournee und sind auf drei Kontinenten aufgetreten. Nach den beiden vielversprechenden EPs “Sungazer Vol.1“ und “Sungazer Vol.2“ veröffentlichten sie 2022 ihre erste LP “Perihelion“. Koproduziert und gemischt von Simon Grove, sowie unter Mitwirkung einer Fülle von Gastmusiker*innen eingespielt, bringen sie hier ihr ästhetisches Programm auf den Punkt. Außerdem tauchen die beiden auf YouTube regelmäßig tief in die Technik ihrer Kunst ein und erreichen mit ihren skurrilen Videoproduktionen ein riesiges Publikum.

Wie Sungazer das Spielerische mit dem Methodischen verbinden und welche glitzernden Klänge sie aus der elektronischen Welt zaubern, lässt sich sehr gut am Beispiel der Tracks 'THICC', 'Drunk' und 'Threshold' nachvollziehen.

Sungazer is an international Future Jazz duo featuring YouTuber / bassist Adam Neely and drummer Shawn Crowder.

Originally formed in Brooklyn, NY in July of 2014, Sungazer has brought their unique blend of hard-hitting Jazz Fusion, 8-bit and Progressive Rock to audiences in the U.S. and Europe. Sungazer explores the human element of improvisation within the context of modern electronic music. Exciting, hard-hitting, and never predictable, Sungazer creates music aimed squarely ahead into the 21st century. They released their sophomore EP entitled Sungazer, Vol.2 in 2019.

On October 11, 2021 they released their debut full-length album, Perihelion. The long-awaited debut LP explores time and the liminal spaces between jazz improvisation and modern electronic music aesthetics. The album was co-produced and mixed by Simon Grove (Plini, Protest The Hero, Intervals) and features an eclectic cast of guest musicians.

Since the release of their first single ‘I’m Starting a Podcast’, Tea Eater have shared the stage with Thee Oh Sees, completed a successful residency at Bushwick venue The Broadway, and toured the U.S. East Coast.

Ob Techno, Drum and Bass, Disco oder Mamas Schlagersammlung – jeder Stil ist willkommen und wird vom Publikum abgefeiert.

FAQ Frage: Wie läuft das mit dem Auflegen? 
Antwort: Zu Beginn jeder Veranstaltung liegt an der Mainbar eine Liste mit den DJ-Slots für den Abend aus. 

Jeder Slot geht eine halbe Stunde und jeder DJ darf nur einen (seinen) Namen in die Liste eintragen.

Jazz, Electronica und Funk, zusammengehalten durch ein frisches Hip-Hop Gerüst, dafür steht das Duo The Herbaliser.  Im Januar 1995 veröffentlichten Ollie Teeba und Jake Wherry alias The Herbaliser ihre erste 12""-Single ""The Real Killer"" beim britischen Label Ninja Tune. Viele werden außerdem ihr im gleichen Jahr erschienenes Debütalbum kennen: ""Remedies“ ist eine Mischung aus harten Breaks, Jazz-Samples und Funk und gehört zu den Klassikern der Genreüberschreitung. Bereits ein Jahr später erschien gleich ein zweiter Klassiker: ""Blow Your Headphones"". Im Zuge der Aufnahmen erweiterten sie ihr Programm um eine achtköpfige Live-Band und verfolgten die Idee, Clubmusik auf Tour zu schicken. Die The Herbaliser Band war geboren und wurde zwei Jahrzehnte lang zu einem festen Bestandteil vieler Elektro-, Dance- und Jazz-Festivals auf der ganzen Welt und war in vielen Clubs zu Hause.

Im Jahr 2020 endete die Zusammenarbeit des ursprünglichen Duos. Jetzt hat sich die Herbaliser Band um Ollie Teeba herum neu aufgestellt und kommt vorbei, um die Alben “Remedies“ und “Blow Your Headphones“ auf die Gretchen-Bühne zu bringen.

Die Besetzung besteht derzeit aus Easy Access AKA Ralph Lamb (Trompete/Flügelhorn), Andrew Ross (Tenor-/Baritonsaxophon), James Morton (Altsaxophon), Micah Moody (Schlagzeug), Patrick Dawes (Perkussion) und Ollie Teeba an den Turntables.

The Herbaliser Band

Way back In January 1995, Ollie Teeba and Jake Wherry AKA The Herbaliser, a
sample-based beatmaking duo from Twickenham, South West London, released their debut 12” single ‘The Real Killer’ on UK label Ninja Tune. The pair were deeply immersed in Hip Hop culture and heavily into digging around in dusty record bins looking for funky samples.
As well as jazz and soul records, they had a particular taste in old movie soundtracks, which would become a particular characteristic of their production sound.
They soon followed up with their first LP, ‘Remedies’ Establishing themselves as one of the main features of the Ninja Tune crew, as they expanded their roster of eclectic artists and DJs. The following year, as they were recording their second full length release, ‘Blow Your Headphones’, they extended their output to include an 8 piece live band and debuted June 1996 at George IV in Brixton. The Herbaliser Band, (which would count among it’s members,
the likes of Easy Access, Chris Bowden and Kaidi Tatham) continued on, touring
internationally, to great reception, from diverse audiences and would become regulars at a multitude of electronic, dance, dub and jazz festivals, worldwide, for the next 2 decades or so.
Finally, in 2020, the relationship, of the production duo that this all began with, came to a conclusion. Yet, in July 2021, when the second pandemic lockdown was in effect, the band performed and recorded a performance for a remote festival in Japan. All bands that year, would perform remotely, if at all.
Now, in 2024, after something of a hiatus, The Herbaliser Band have reformed with a lineup that currently includes Easy Access AKA Ralph Lamb (trumpet/flugelhorn) & Andrew Ross
(tenor/baritone sax-flute), James Morton (alto sax), Micah Moody (drums), Patrick Dawes (percussion) & Ollie Teeba on the turntables.  

For this event we offer discounted tickets to give people with less money still access to culture. These quotas are limited and only available at TixforGigs. We trust in your self-assessment: If you can, please book standard tickets and leave the reduced tickets to those who have to save money at the moment.",Gretchen-Berlin,"https://gretchen-club.de, https://www.tixforgigs.com/de-de/Event/55397"

Besser als Mozart“ steht eine smarte Leichtigkeit: Einmal vom The Hans-Sound gepackt, hat uns ein beschwingter Rock’n’Roll im Griff, der mit dem Punk scharfsinniger, ironischer und genauso humorvoller Texte Hand in Hand geht. 
Schließlich ist The Hans „Iggys rechte Faust“ und „Bowies schwarzes Auge“, wie es eine der wenigen Infos über ihn im Netz, hier das Fever Creek Festival, preisgeben. Doch wer surfend durch die Datensätze auf der Suche nach mehr Infos ist, stößt, in einen direkten Sog geratend, auf seine Songs: Beseelt und bei einem Gitarren-Sound, der schon mit The Kinks oder The Monks verglichen wurde, führt uns The Hans beispielsweise durch „Iggy’s City“ oder schmeißt mit messerscharfem Witz Spekulanten aus Berlin raus – all das nur einen Griff zur E-Gitarre entfernt!

""Was des Tigers täglich Brot (der waghalsige Sprung durch den Feuerreif) ist für The Hans der beherzte Griff zur E-Gitarre. Für so einen Zirkus gibt es wohl keinen besseren Ort als das Eschschloraque. The Hans spielt wohldressierten Punk, charmant und bissig, frei von Tierquälerei und auch textlich immer einen Sprung voraus."" (Artist Statement)

Für so ein Konzert gibt es wohl kaum eine bessere Gastgeberin als MissVergnügen. Seit jeher gestaltet sie den Berliner Underground als Musikerin und DJ mit, zuerst in der „selbst-zur-Bar-ernannten“ Garage im Hinterhof des berühmt-berüchtigten Eimer, in der Waffengalerie oder im King-Kong-Klub. Seit 2006 bespielt sie die Mittwochabende im Eschschloraque mit eklektischen Sets und gibt der Subkultur mit DJ-Gästen und Konzerten, wie The Hans, wieder eine Stimme. Ein vergnüglicher Zirkus. Besser als Mozart und Bach zusammen.

Nach einer sensationellen Show im letzten Jahr, kommt die britische Saxophonistin Jasmine Myra im Oktober wieder bei uns vorbei und bringt auch gleich ein neues Album mit. Wunderschön arrangiert, verbindet “Rising“ Jasmine Myras musikalische Einflüsse zwischen Kenny Wheeler, Bonobo, Olafur Arnalds und Shabaka Hutchings zu einem stimmigen Ganzen.  Ihre spirituelle Instrumentalmusik hat einen euphorischen und erhebenden Klang und weist dabei eine ganz besondere Qualität auf - schwelgerisch, melodisch und glückselig, ohne in Sentimentalität abzugleiten.

Die Saxophonistin, Komponistin und Bandleaderin Jasmine Myra stammt aus Leeds und lebt heute in London. Seit 2022 ist sie bei Gondwana Records unter Vertrag und arbeitet eng mit Labelbesitzer und Produzent Matthew Halsall zusammen, dessen Gespür für Talente bereits die Musik von GoGo Penguin, Mammal Hands und Hania Rani in die Welt getragen hat. Im Sommer 2022 veröffentlichte sie ihr hochgelobtes Debütalbum Horizons"", das von der Kritik begeistert aufgenommen wurde. Mit Clubshows und Festivalauftritten in ganz Großbritannien und auf dem europäischen Festland nahm ihre Karriere rasant Fahrt auf.

“Rising“ knüpft nahtlos an die Qualität des Vorgängers an und ist ein wichtiges Statement für den britischen Jazz. Aufgenommen hat sie das Album erneut mit dem Gitarristen Ben Haskins, dem Schlagzeuger George Hall, dem Pianisten Jasper Green, der Harfenistin Alice Roberts und dem Bassisten Sam Quintana, die gemeinsam die subtilen Texturen von Myras Musik gekonnt unterstreichen und mit einer kollektiven Sensibilität und Dynamik spielen, die die Musik wirklich auf eine strahlende Reise schickt. Don’t miss!

Für diese Veranstaltung bieten wir ermäßigte Tickets an, um auch Menschen mit kleinerem Portmonee Zugang zu Kultur zu ermöglichen. Diese Kontingente sind limitiert und nur bei TixforGigs verfügbar. Wir vertrauen auf Eure Selbsteinschätzung: Wenn ihr könnt, bucht Standard-Tickets und überlasst die ermäßigten Kontingente denjenigen, die gerade sehr sparen müssen.

_________________________________________


After a sensational show last year, British saxophonist Jasmine Myra returns in October with a new album.

Jasmine Myra is a saxophonist, composer and bandleader from Leeds, now based in London. Her original instrumental music has a euphoric and uplifting sound, influenced by artists as diverse as Bonobo, Olafur Arnalds and Kenny Wheeler, whose music shares an emotive quality that can also be heard in Jasmine's own compositions. In early 2022, she signed to Gondwana Records and worked with label owner and producer Matthew Halsall (whose keen ear for talent has helped bring the music of GoGo Penguin, Mammal Hands and Hania Rani to the wider world) to deliver her critically acclaimed debut album 'Horizons' in summer 2022.

Following the release of 'Horizons', Jasmine's musical career and profile skyrocketed over the next year and a half. Brilliant reviews worldwide, massive radio airplay and top streaming playlists led to major tours and festival appearances across the UK and mainland Europe.

Elevating, uplifting and beautifully arranged: Jasmine Myra's second album 'Rising' builds on the success of her groundbreaking debut to deliver a major statement from one of the UK's rising jazz stars. Produced by Matthew Halsall and mixed by Greg Freeman, 'Rising' is a confident and vibrant follow-up that connects the musical dots between Myra's influences Kenny Wheeler, Bonobo and Shabaka Hutchings to create something unique, beautiful and profound.

‘Rising’ features the same core of musicians as ‘Horizons’, with guitarist Ben Haskins, drummer George Hall pianist Jasper Green, harpist Alice Roberts and bassist Sam Quintana who collectively bring a deft understating of the subtle textures of Myra’s music and perform with a collective empathy and drive that really pushes the music on a radiant journey.

For this event we offer discounted tickets to give people with less money still access to culture. These quotas are limited and only available at TixforGigs.

31.10.2024 | Einlass 20.00 Uhr | Start ca. 21.15 Uhr

Nur im INSOMNIA BERLIN | Drinks inklusive*

Besucht uns in einem der bekanntesten Fetisch Clubs Deutschlands: Dem Insomnia Berlin! Dort findet die erste und einzige erotische Hypnose Party Deutschlands statt. Präsentiert von Erotische-Hypnose.com

Ab 20.00 Uhr begrüßen wir Euch und um ca. 21.15 Uhr startet das Programm. Bitte achtet darauf pünktlich zu sein, da wir während der Hypnose niemanden mehr reinlassen können!

Erotik-Hypnotiseur „ViVe“ zeigt Euch in seiner Show zuerst was mit erotischer Hypnose möglich ist. Danach kann jeder selbst erleben, wie erotische Hypnose sich anfühlt und sich direkt von ViVe hypnotisieren lassen!

Als Höhepunkt des Abends wird er Euch, mittels Hypnose, tief in euer eigenes Lustzentrum hineinführen: So tief, dass nichts anderes mehr als Eure Lust existiert.

Danach werdet Ihr voll und ganz von eurem Verlangen und Eurer Lust kontrolliert — bis ihr Sex braucht, wie die Luft zum Atmen.   Und was dann geschieht… liegt ganz allein bei Euch!

Zielgruppe: Ideal für Paare und Singles, die sich gern einmal hypnotisieren lassen wollen, um sich danach ihrer Lust hinzugeben.

Ein wichtiger Hinweis zur Hypnose:

Es geschehen nur Dinge, die Du selbst auch willst. Es wird niemand „vorgeführt“ und du kannst auch nur Zuschauer sein. Dabei gilt: Das Erlebnis ist nur so gut, soweit du dich darauf einlässt. Du selbst hast jederzeit die Kontrolle. Auch darüber, diese abzugeben und es in deinem Geist explodieren zu lassen!

Bitte beachtet:

Wir werden versuchen auf ein ausgewogenes Verhältnis von Paaren, Frauen und Single-Männern zu achten. Auch wenn „hemmungslose Lust“ im Vordergrund der Party steht, so ist dies keine HÜ oder Gang Bang Party. Durch Hypnose wird niemand „willenlos“ und wer andere belästigt, weil er glaubt durch Hypnose „schnell zum Schuss“ zu kommen, wird sehr schnell und konsequent die Party verlassen müssen.

ACHTUNG: KEINE EINLASSGARANTIE – Wir sorgen für ein ausgewogenes Verhältnis zwischen Männern und Frauen und das letzte Wort hat der Türsteher vom Insomnia!

*Alle Softdrinks, Bier, Wein und Sekt sind im Preis inklusive!

P﻿reise:

Single Frauen - 39 EUR

S﻿ingle Männer - 99 EUR

P﻿aare - 69 EUR

Nach dem Euch Vive um 21.00 Uhr in einer kurzen Show – unter Einsatz seiner mitgebrachten „Spielzeuge“ – gezeigt hat, was mit erotischer Hypnose alles möglich ist, seid Ihr an der Reihe!

In einer darauf folgenden Gruppen-Trance lässt VIVE zuerst alle in tiefe Hypnose sinken. Während dieser Trance gibt ViVe dann unterschiedliche Suggestionen. Dabei kann jeder für sich selbst entscheiden, welche Suggestionen der- oder diejenige während der Hypnose für sich akzeptieren möchte.

Folgende hypnotischen „Höhepunkte“ hat ViVe für Dich auf der Party vorbereitet:

Exklusive „Insomnia Trance“:

Das Insomnia ist eine andere Welt. Und in dieser Trance werdet ihr den Alltag hinter Euch lassen. Aller Stress, alle Sorgen, alles was Euch blockiert, bleibt draußen. Und Ihr seid frei, Eure Fantasien zu leben und werdet Euch sinnlich, selbstbewusst und sexy fühlen. Wenn Ihr wollt, könnt Ihr diesen Trigger bei Euch behalten und die Effekte danach jedes Mal fühlen, sobald Ihr das Insomnia betretet.

Erregungs-Trigger:

Stellt Euch vor, jeder (dem Ihr es erlaubt!) braucht nur ein Wort zu sagen, und Ihr werdet sofort geil werden. Nur ein Wort in Euer Ohr geflüstert und Euer Körper reagiert mit purer Lust. Dieser Trigger wird nur bei Personen funktionieren, von denen Ihr wollt, dass sie ihn benutzen können und er wird nach dem Verlassen des Insomnia seine Wirkung verlieren.

Erhöhte Wahrnehmung:

Ihr habt bestimmt davon gehört, wie ein Zahnarzt mit Hypnose den Schmerz nehmen kann. Wir machen das Gegenteil. Stellt Euch vor, all Eure erogenen Zonen werden empfindlicher und sinnlicher. Jede Berührung wird intensiver. Und Eure Haut wird sich nach Berührung sehnen.

Hypnotischer Orgasmus:

Du willst kommen? Ohne, dass Du Dich dabei anfassen musst? Dann lass Dich auf einen hypnotischen Orgasmus ein und erlebe einen Höhepunkt wie noch nie zuvor.

Verloren in der Lust:

Sozusagen der „Höhepunkt“ nach dem „Höhepunkt“ des Abends. Ihr werdet Euch auf eine Reise tief in die Lust begeben — so tief, dass nichts anderes mehr zählt. Zu einem Ort an dem Ihr voll und ganz von Eurem Verlangen und Eurer Lust kontrolliert werdet. Bis Ihr Sex braucht, wie die Luft zum Atmen.

Und was nach dieser Hypnose geschieht… liegt dann ganz allein an Euch! Die gut ausgestatteten Spielräume des Insomnia stehen Euch zur Verfügung!

a night where music, art, and community come together with the purest intention. This is more than just a night out, it’s a family gathering, a space where we celebrate culture and connection. For 9 hours, we’ll share an intimate journey guided by 3 incredible artists, each taking the stage for 3 hours, letting their music speak directly to your soul. The lineup will remain a surprise, because here, it’s not about who’s playing 

it’s about the music itself, the energy we create together, and the values we uphold.

This is a place of respect, where we come together as a community that values authenticity, openness, and love for the culture. We believe that music is not only for dancing, but a powerful force for change, and a reflection of who we are. As a special treat, a guest visual artist will be presenting their work, adding another layer of artistry to the night.

We can’t wait to welcome you all, our extended family, to share this experience with us. Let’s create something beautiful, together. See you at LARK

Auf seinem aktuellen Album “Evergreen“ jongliert er mit Elementen aus Jazz, Gospel, Hip-Hop, Klassik und Electronica. Keyboardsounds, Vocoder und digitale Drums treffen auf reiche Melodie- und Harmonieparts, das Ganze klingt hochmodern, ist ebenso eingängig wie komplex und geht sofort ins Ohr. Beschränkte er sich auf dem Vorgänger “Let Sound Tell All“ noch weitgehend auf seine Hauptinstrumente Klavier und Schlagzeug, so spielt er hier neben diversen Keyboards und Percussion auch Bass, Gitarre und Klarinette.

Auf die Frage nach den Genres hat er eine klare und schöne Antwort: ""Ich hoffe, ihr hört das hier und vergesst die ganze Sache mit den Genrebezeichnungen"", sagt er. ""Das ist einfach Musik, zu der man tanzen, fühlen und denken kann. Evergreen geht durch eine ganze Reihe von Genres, aber das ist die Welt, die ich sehe und höre. Das ist das Gefühl, das ich hervorrufe. Ich habe ein Statement abgegeben und gesagt: Das Genre bin nur ich"". Kurzum: Julius Rodriguez verkörpert den wahren Geist des Jazz, indem er ihn völlig befreit in die Zukunft führt.

Wer im Alter von 25 Jahren bereits eine derart ausgereifte Musikalität an den Tag legt, muss sich wohl das Prädikat Wunderkind gefallen lassen. Rodriguez ist ein Multitalent: Klavier und Harmonielehre zu beherrschen, helfe ihm beim Schlagzeugspielen, das wiederum die rhythmische Dimension des Klaviers besser erfasse, sagt er. Sein Werdegang in Stichworten: mit zwölf an der Manhattan School of Music, mit vierzehn erste Auftritte, dann ans legendäre Julliard. Beim Betty Carter Workshop wurde er unter anderem von Jason Moran unterrichtet. Inzwischen hat er mit Wynton Marsalis, Roy Hargrove oder Meshell Ndegeocello gearbeitet und war Mitglied des Onyx Collective.

Für diese Veranstaltung bieten wir ermäßigte Tickets an, um auch Menschen mit kleinerem Portmonee Zugang zu Kultur zu ermöglichen. Diese Kontingente sind limitiert und nur bei TixforGigs verfügbar. Wir vertrauen auf Eure Selbsteinschätzung: Wenn ihr könnt, bucht Standard-Tickets und überlasst die ermäßigten Kontingente denjenigen, die gerade sehr sparen müssen.

_____________________________________


No matter where, Julius Rodriguez, the New York-born and Los Angeles-based multi-instrumentalist, composer, and producer electrifies any lane. By doing so, he also transcends perceived boundaries between genres and styles, redefining the music to mirror his own fluid creative inclinations and delivering a sound that's solely his alone.
Following widespread applause from The New York Times, Vanity Fair, The FADER, and more, collaborations with everyone from Wynton Marsalis to A$AP Rocky, and tens of millions of streams, he grows in as many directions as possible on his second full-length offering, EVERGREEN [Verve Records].

""An 'EVERGREEN' is a plant whose foliage remains functional for all seasons. That's similar to how I like to be; I want to be myself no matter the genre I'm playing or what's going on around me. There are a lot of styles on this record, but it's recognizably my voice.""
By breaking boundaries with EVERGREEN, Julius has lived up to the true spirit of jazz by ushering it towards the future freely. ""I hope you hear this and forget about the whole genre labeling thing,"" he leaves off. ""This is just music you can dance to, feel to, and think to. It's not about categorizing; it's about enjoying something for what it is. EVERGREEN goes through a whole bunch of genres, but this is the world I'm seeing and hearing. This is the feeling I'm invoking. I made a statement and said, 'The genre is just me'.""

For this event we offer discounted tickets to give people with less money still access to culture. These quotas are limited and only available at TixforGigs. We trust in your self-assessment: If you can, please book standard tickets and leave the reduced tickets to those who have to save money at the moment.

A mix of guests that couldn't be more exciting with sexy freaks, young hoppers, glamorous clubbers and tasty night owls can look forward to a particularly danceable combination this time.

Berlin DJs and national acts will be at the turntables playing a sound that can only be experienced at ""Young Love"". Sophisticated. Driving. Innovative.

And while you're rocking out in the main hall, adventurous guests can have fun in the BDSM catacombs, the couple's gallery or the Jacuzzi. A love patrol is always on the move in the club, ensures your safety and is always approachable.

And all this in a club where all age groups feel comfortable, and also dare to climb new paths of passion or just party wildly - the INSOMNIA.

Even in the often financially difficult times after the pandemic, we want to continue to please all youngsters and give free admission to all visitors between 18 and 25 years.",InsomniaClub,https://www.insomnia-berlin.de

The Early Days is a journey back in time to the golden decade of indie, when the big bands like Arctic Monkey, Bloc Party & The Killers churned out hit albums and wrote music history. Those were the days... The Early Days. Of course, among all the freakout- and singalong songs, pioneers like The Smiths, Oasis and Queen shouldn't be missing.

Metaphorically, it can represent a psychological, philosophical, or artistic change in the understanding of a situation, idea, or truth, depending on one’s perspective. The title of 3hd’s “Underworld” concert and performance event at Silent Green Kulturquartier’s Betonhalle suggests such multiplicity, with its subterranean prefix representing just one of many possible worlds and interpretations.

As its own modification to the repurposed Wedding crematorium complex, the below-ground concrete hall hosts a monumental night of music and live performance, ritual and ceremony, that delves into the infinite possibilities, potentialities, and planes of existence influencing our every day. Casey MQ explores the fluid and unreliable nature of memory through introspective piano and vocal arrangements, and Yawning Portal’s highly deconstructed and improvised live set creates an ambient devotional of ""music to levitate to."" Playing material from their forthcoming album, The Fertile Crescent’s Oxhy and Susu Laroche merge folk anthems and mystic drone metal to explore the sublime space of communal ritual and emotional exchange. MIRA新伝統’s performance of sentient geography and ceremonial resistance to commodification challenges societal norms through their cosmic narratives blending experimental fiction, shamanic culture, and AI-generated visuals.

Sorour Darabi’s “FROM THE THROAT TO THE DAWN” centerpiece embraces transformation, identity, and contemporary myth through performance and dance. Created in collaboration with Pablo Altar and Ange Halliwell, the performance reinterprets ""night"" through the lens of One Thousand and One Nights’s central Scheherazade character. Bassem Saad & Sanja Grozdanić’s script-based performance, “Permanent Trespass (Beirut of the Balkans and the American Century)” contends with the possibility and mutability of mourning through protracted catastrophe as the frame of who or what is being mourned appears to shift and unsettle, giving form to the double exposure of past and present occurring at moments of historic transition. Meanwhile, vocal ensemble XTC IN THE XIV applies live electronics to early polyphonic choral arrangements, using time-stretched and pitch-shifted samples to probe the uncanny and cross-temporal relationships in music, while Yi Li’s “Eternal Death” video installation recreates and reorganizes abstract sensory experiences in physical and digital spaces. Shaly López’s scenography generates atmospheric compositions that challenge perception by staging non-physical dimensions, such as dreams and meditative states through sound, light, and scent.

The existence of an underworld assumes an overworld, and many more worlds that reflect each other in an infinite mirror of duplicate glass surfaces that go on forever. This effect of light bouncing back and forth, at equal yet opposite angles, creates the illusion of limitless space and reveals deeper insights into the boundless possibilities of parallax.

Making their first collaborative appearance in Berlin are vocalist extraordinaire Sofia Jernberg and cellist Judith Hamann, presenting their commissioned work from MADEIRADiG last year. They will be joined by Berlin-based composer and psychoacoustic researcher Ben Glas.

Born in Ethiopia and raised in Vietnam, Stockholm-based Sofia Jernberg is an exceptional singer and composer. With a background in jazz, she focuses on unconventional techniques and sounds such as non-verbal vocalisation, split tones and toneless singing. Music theatre and contemporary opera also play an important role in Jernberg’s artistic oeuvre. 
In 2023, she made her debuts with the Collegium Novum Zurich, Ensemble Resonanz and the Lucerne Festival Contemporary Orchestra.

Originally from Melbourne, Judith Hamann is a cellist meanwhile based in Berlin whose process-based creative practice encompasses electroacoustic music, site-specific generative work and microtonal systems. The Wire posited that Judith “destroys the fiction of the musician who lives and works outside conventional parameters and puts in its place a series of compositions that are fundamentally humane.”

Ben Glas is an experimental composer who moved from Portland to pursue Sonic Studies at the Berlin University of the Arts. Through ephemeral compositions, he questions preconceived notions of passive hearing versus active listening. His works focus on the realms of subjective perception and cognition via the use of acoustics, psychoacoustics and space as tools for sonic composition.

Founded over three centuries ago, the Akademie der Künste is one of Europe’s oldest cultural institutes. Designed by architect Werner Düttmann, Hanseatenweg is a generous, yet modest ensemble of three different buildings encompassed by courtyards and gardens, a proper site to ring out the year before we take our winter break.",digitalinberlin,"https://www.digitalinberlin.de/category/db-presents/kiezsalon/, https://www.eventbrite.de/o/digital-in-berlin-17478803114"

He returns to Europe this October with his Avantdale Bowling Club project, following sold out shows in 2023.

Over the course of two albums, Avantdale Bowling Club (2018) and Trees (2022), Tom has worked with musicians and producers in New Zealand to craft a vivid intermingling of jazz, soul, hip-hop and electronica. Written from a working class perspective at the bottom of the globe, Scott’s lyrics explore the day-to-day realities of life lived on the margins of society. 

Sad and celebratory in equal measure, Avantdale Bowling Club has been lauded by NPR, Refuge Worldwide and Radio New Zealand. The debut release won the coveted Album of the Year and best Hip-Hop artist at the Aotearoa Music Awards followed by Independent Music NZ’s Taite Music Prize for best album release. At the end of 2022 the follow-up Trees debuted at number 1 on the NZ album charts.  

Raised on jazz, soul, funk and rap, Scott has honed his skills as a rapper, songwriter and bandleader through membership in several cult groups (@Peace, Average Rap Band). He first emerged in 2007 with Home Brew, a band that has recently returned to the touring circuit and the top of the NZ charts with an unexpected second album, Run It Back. Scott’s other projects, and his burgeoning Years Gone By label, ensure that he continues to influence and push boundaries across genres.

In May 2023 he made his UK debut, selling out two shows at London’s Ninety One Living Room and playing at The Great Escape festival in Brighton, before returning in November for a sold-out show at Islington Assembly Hall as part of London Jazz Festival.

Based in New York City, Laraaji began playing music on the streets in the 1970s, improvising trance-inducing jams on a modified autoharp processed through various electronic effects. Influential British musician and record producer Brian Eno saw him playing one night in Washington Square Park and invited him to record an album of ambient music at his studio. Laraaji went on to release a prolific series of albums for a wide variety of labels, many of which he recorded himself at home and sold as cassettes during his street performances. In recent years his profile has enjoyed a renaissance via a series of new and reissued recordings on the All Saints label, as well as worldwide performances, laughter meditation workshops and deep listening sessions.

Patrick Shiroishi is a Japanese-American multi-instrumentalist and composer based in Los Angeles who is perhaps best known for his extensive and incredibly intense work with the saxophone. Over the last decade he has established himself as one of the premier improvising musicians in Los Angeles, playing solo and in numerous collaborative projects. Shiroishi may well be considered a foundational player in the city’s vast musical expanse.

Woran das liegt? Resavoir ist ein kollaboratives Projekt um den in Chicago geborenen Produzenten Will Miller. Der klassisch ausgebildete Trompeter und Komponist ist Mitglied der Indie-Band Whitney und hat unter anderem mit Mac Miller, Lil Wayne, A$AP Rocky und SZA zusammengearbeitet. Inspiriert von Indie-Rock und Hip-Hop hat er die daraus entstandenen Mischformen mit seiner eigenen Sensibilität versehen und einen charakteristischen, beat-orientierten, üppigen und cineastischen Soul-Jazz-Sound entwickelt.

Mit Resavoir tritt Miller in die Rolle des Bandleaders und hat für die Aufnahmen zu den beiden Alben ""Resavoir I"" und ""Resavoir II"" jeweils ein Dutzend Instrumentalist*innen aus der Jazz- und Improv-Szene Chicagos um sich versammelt. Miller lässt seine Trompete durch MIDI-Keyboards laufen, experimentiert mit Samplern, Drumcomputern und Synthesizern und entwickelt dabei einen Sound, der ihm eine nahtlose Zusammenarbeit ermöglicht.

Die Musik ist größtenteils instrumental, getragen von Pop-Appeal und Melodien, die so eingängig sind, dass man das Gefühl hat, sie wären schon immer um einen herum gewesen, dabei aber komplex, ausbalanciert und nie verkopft. Subtil strahlende Symphonien, die uns den Glauben zurückgeben können, dass die Welt doch irgendwie in Ordnung ist.

Für diese Veranstaltung bieten wir ermäßigte Tickets an, um auch Menschen mit kleinerem Portmonee Zugang zu Kultur zu ermöglichen. Diese Kontingente sind limitiert und nur bei TixforGigs verfügbar. Wir vertrauen auf Eure Selbsteinschätzung: Wenn ihr könnt, bucht Standard-Tickets und überlasst die ermäßigten Kontingente denjenigen, die gerade sehr sparen müssen.

This time, the focus is on voice and sound experimentation: let yourself be mesmerized by the mysticism of singer Cindy Pooch and the onirism of pop-electro duo O'o for a Club InFiné that brings to you the finest of experimental chanson.


Cindy Pooch


Singer-songwriter from Cameroon, Cindy Pooch has been writing and exploring a wide range of music for several years: trip hop, soul, maloya... Until now, she had been a performer for others, before releasing her critically acclaimed 1st solo album “In Nomine Corpus” in 2023. Today, her artistic experiments are mainly motivated by the desire to use voice, words and sound sensations as tools to trigger or accompany healing processes.


O'o


The duo O'o is made up of two strange birds: Victoria Suter and Mathieu Daubigné blend experimental pop, electronica and song. A singular, offbeat blend that evokes the lyrical accents of Kate Bush, the dreaminess of Björk and the groove of Little Dragon. Their music stands out for its vocal creativity and polished production. After releasing their 1st album “Touche” in 2022, O'o are back with a second album, “Songs of Wishes and Bones”, a collection of stories between light and shadow, the 1st chapter of which is set for release in October 2024.",timinfine,"https://infine-music.com/oo/, https://infine-music.com/cindy-pooch/, https://infine-music.com/"

Ein experimentelles Rockprojekt mit der Aggressivität und Einfachheit des Punk. Blanco Teta ist mehr als nur eine Musikgruppe – es ist eine kreative und visuelle Erfahrung, die einen direkten Dialog mit dem Publikum herstellt. Unbarmherzige, verzerrte Klanglandschaften, kantige Darbietungen, ein transfeministisches Konzept mit avantgardistischem Ansatz. Ein Konzert von Blanco Teta zu erleben, bedeutet, in eine immersiv-intensive Atmosphäre einzutauchen, die von purer Energie und künstlerischer Unkonventionalität geprägt ist.

Transfeminist noiserock:

The band itself describes its music as an experimental rock project, with the aggressiveness and simplicity of punk but with a great twist: relentless distorted noise soundscapes, edgy performance, transfeminist concept and an avant-garde approach. Based in Buenos Aires this quartet is a great live band with an unique sound, partly because of the presence of a cello.

Ihr Set-Up aus Drums, Keys und Vocals mutet minimalistisch an, ihr Sound ist alles andere als das. Alle, die im letzten Jahr das Konzert im Gretchen erlebt haben, wissen das.

Die kroatische Pianistin und Sängerin Sara Ester Gredelj und die slowenische Schlagzeugerin Nina Korošak-Serčič begannen ihre Zusammenarbeit im Jahr 2019 mit der Veröffentlichung ihrer ersten Single „I'm gonna live“. Im Jahr 2020 veröffentlichten sie ihre erste EP mit dem Titel „not good enough“. 2023 ist mit ""Since Always And Forever"" ihr Debüt Album erschienen. Lässig groovende, präzise und jazzig verschleppte Beats treiben die Tracks voran, getragen von so pointierten wie gefühlvollen Klavier- und Synthesizer-Sounds und gefühlvoll vorgetragener Lyrik.

freekind. machen Musik mit Botschaft, subtil und aus dem Flow heraus. So ist ihre Single “Good News“ eine Liebeserklärung an das Leben jenseits der schlechten Nachrichten und enthält die Aufforderung, sich auf Liebe und Hoffnung zu beziehen. Oft finden wir beides in unseren täglichen Begegnungen. Schön, das sie auf ihrer “Good News Tour“ wieder zu uns kommen. Also: Seid frei, seid freundlich und kommt zum Konzert, es gibt gute Nachrichten.

_______________________________________


The soulful group is composed of Croatian pianist and vocalist Sara Ester Gredelj and Slovenian drummer Nina Korošak-Serčič. Their songs carry a strong message of love and hope, complemented by R&B and Jazz grooves.

The music scene got acquainted with the duo in 2020 with their EP “not good enough”. Their first full-length album “Since Always And Forever,” released under the label Butter92 and distributed by Légère Recordings, features 12 songs, including singles like Visualize, Happiness, Good Vibrations, Bright Light, and Carry You.

The album channels the essence of the golden age of hip-hop but in a fresh and innovative way, incorporating elements of pop, neo-soul, and jazz. The result is a distinctive sound that pays homage to its roots while pushing boundaries and creating its own path. It is a testament to freekind.’s ability to blend genres and create a sound that is both nostalgic and progressive.

 The ongoing joke is that their live performances are a sort of group therapy with the songs sharing something that’s inside all of us, in a way that evokes understanding and empathy. With the groove, it is the perfect combination. Music that moves you and MOVES you, if you know what I mean. 

For this event we offer discounted tickets to give people with less money still access to culture. These quotas are limited and only available at TixforGigs. We trust in your self-assessment: If you can, please book standard tickets and leave the reduced tickets to those who have to save money at the moment.

The music of 𝘈𝘭𝘭 𝘓𝘪𝘧𝘦 𝘓𝘰𝘯𝘨 simmers in an ever-shifting tension between repetition and variation. The pieces for brass, organ, and voice provide nearly continuous timbral fluctuation even as thematic material reiterates, their internal framework of fractal pattern permutations has the paradoxical effect of creating anticipated keystone moments of dramatic reverie and lulling the listener into believing in an illusory endlessness.

Sounding the massive organ in Berlin’s iconic Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche with additional organ accompaniment by Stephen O’Malley, Malone will be joined by Macadam Ensemble vocal quartet, and a five-piece microtonal brass ensemble consisting of Elena Kakaliagou, Johannes Lauer, Magnus Schriefl, Rike Huy, and Weston Olencki.

They soon discovered that their individual strengths complemented each other perfectly. Two very different worlds collide and lead to minimalist dark wave deconstructions that are equal parts brutal and erotic.

This duality is reflected in the name Skemer, which next to its obvious English meaning of 'intriguer' also stands for ‘dusk’ in Mathieu’s native tongue West-Flemish. The band recorded their debut album just months after meeting and this sense of urgency shines through in their effervescent live performances, where Peers seductive vocals coalesce with Vandekerckhove's austere beats to meld into a transcendent fury.

Debut album Benevolence is released on the 25th of October 2019 on Avant! Records. In 2022 a remix of the song “Sunseeker by Dana Montana was released on He.She.They Records.

Kim Peers has a background in the high end fashion world. She’s born and raised in fashion capital, Antwerp, where she started working in the 90’s with Inge Grognard and Ronald Stoops. She soon traveled the world for several high fashion magazines, runways and campaigns, such as Vogue, Prada, YSL and many more. To this day she’s still having fun with modeling in fashion. She also has a background in music. Under her own name her EP “Tell Me More” was released on DJ Hell ’s International Gigolos Records in 2004, with remixes by Mt Sims and David Carretta. The remix of David Carretta appeared on a compilation from Dave Clarke in 2005. In 2012 she started a no wave-punk band called Crimpers they released a 7” in 2012 on Dennis Tyfus’ Ultra Eczema records. Throughout the years she also enjoyed dj’ing. Meeting the Drag Me To Hell family felt like coming home and somewhere around 2018 Mati Drome, the founder of DMTH, invited her to become a resident dj at the Drag Me To Hell raves.

Mathieu Vandekerckhove is guitarist and a founding member of the post-metal band Amenra, Absent In Body and his personal project Syndrome. Amenra was formed in 1999 in the West Flanders city of Kortrijk. The band was founded by vocalist Colin H. van Eeckhout, lead guitarist Mathieu Vandekerckhove and bassist Kristof Mondy. The three had been in the hardcore punk band Spineless that split up in 1999 and wanted to create music with more ""heart and soul”. Absent In Body originally formed in 2017 originally as the mutual vision of guitarist Vandekerckhove and Neurosis frontman Kelly, who, in conspiracy with Iggor Cavalera (ex-Sepultura, Cavalera Conspiracy, Petbrick,...) and Amenra’s Colin H. van Eeckhout, conjured a sprawling, episodic blend of post-metal and sludge. Atmosphere is key here, whether it's the tribal drums against a squall of controlled noise that open ""The Acres/The Ache,"" the mountain-cleaving riffs or the reflective, minimalist passages which offer a melodic reprieve.",educationlost,https://www.facebook.com/events/1082447753438059/

Thursday, 07.11 @ Neue Zukunft Berlin 
GNOD (UK) + MC Sissi
Support: Sophie-T

Over the past decade, Gnod has evolved into one of the most unpredictable and intriguing bands in the experimental music scene. Their sonic explorations have ranged from the cosmic pastoral landscapes reminiscent of their collaborations with White Hills to their more recent ventures into post-punk on albums like ""Just Say No..."" and the noise rock intensity of ""Hexen Valley"". Despite the diverse range of sounds, each release offers something extraordinary, keeping listeners eagerly anticipating what they'll do next. Gnod continues to push boundaries, delivering fresh, thought-provoking music that challenges conventional genre definitions.


Support:
Sophie-T (DE)

Sophie-T is a multidisciplinary poet from Weimar, Germany, whose creative work blends poetry and spoken word performance with visual art and paintings. Her art often bridges the worlds of literature and visual aesthetics, where sound and language interact with imagery and textures. By combining spoken word sounds with her paintings, Sophie-T creates immersive artistic experiences that engage both the auditory and visual senses. Her work typically explores themes deeply rooted in personal expression, emotional depth, and experimental narrative, offering a unique fusion of performance and visual arts.

⫸⫸ ABOUT FOUR PLAY ⫸⫸
Imagine a party in which you're not just moving your feet on the dance floor. Imagine a place full of color and fantasy, in which you are welcomed to take part in the action.
In 2016, the Four Play project was born in order to breach the all-too-serious walls of those days' Berlin kinky and fetish scenes, and to allow the young and the inexperienced to experiment with many aspects of the kinky lifestyle and their own sexuality.
In the mean, Four Play has become one of Berlin’s most beautiful sex-positive and kinky parties, offering not just an uncompromising musical lineup, but also an incredibly rich program of performances and workshops, all designed for our guests to interact and become an active part of the night.

⫸⫸ WHAT TO EXPECT ⫸⫸
▻ High-end Techno journey on the Main Floor, happy modern interpretations of House music in the Dragon Floor, and Downtempo to Soft-Tech in the basement.
▻ Around 80 Performances, walking acts and Workshops.
▻ A Kinky Marketplace to upgrade your outfits.
▻ Hedonistic safe space for kinksters and LGTBQ.
▻ A large, highly dedicated Awareness Team.

⫸⫸ MUST READ ⫸⫸
▻ NO PRESALE. Tickets only at the door.
▻ The Four Play has a strict no-photo and no phone policy. We have a designated photobooth with our photographer, where photos can be taken of those who wish for it.
▻ The Four Play is a safe space for any ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. Any sign of racism, sexism, or homophobia will not be tolerated.
▻ You are to respect the personal space of any fellow dancer. In case you feel that you have been treated wrongly, or that your space has been violated, please notify our awareness team or our staff immediately.
▻ DRESS-CODE: * Sexy Swimsuits * Costumes * Leather * Latex * Naked * Super Heroes * Lingerie * Colorful Festival Style.
NO CASUAL STREET WEAR SUCH AS JEANS IS ALLOWED.

FAQ
1. Can single or groups of hetero men join the party?
- In general, women, and queers are rarely a threat to a sexpositive concept. Men are more carefully selected, and would have to be able to prove acquaintance with the guidelines of consent.
2. Are normal bathing or boxer shorts enough?
- No, they aren’t. With swimwear we mean sexy swimwear (yes men, better show us your Speedos).
3. Is the usual Kitkat or Four Play dress code enough?
- Yes, they are, however, we kindly ask you to make an effort and adapt to the Four Play colourful character.
4. Am I allowed to masturbate in front of people or playful couples?
- No, you’re not. Solo-Wankers are not welcomed at the Four Play and without explicit consent, are considered an harassment.
5. What do I do if I or someone around me feel uncomfortable or mistreated?
- Please report that to our Awareness Team immediately. You can either find them patrolling the club in shiny vests, or at the Awareness Station at the Pool Bar.

⫸⫸ ÜBER DIE FOUR PLAY ⫸⫸
Stellt euch eine Party vor, bei der ihr nicht nur eure Füße auf der Tanzfläche bewegt. Stellt euch einen Ort voller Farbe und Fantasie vor, an dem ihr eingeladen seid, am Programm teilzunehmen.
Im Jahr 2016 wurde das Projekt Four Play ins Leben gerufen, um die allzu ernsten Mauern der damaligen Berliner Kinky- und Fetischszene zu durchbrechen und jungen und unerfahrenen Menschen die Möglichkeit zu geben, mit vielen Aspekten des kinky Lebensstils und ihrer eigenen Sexualität zu experimentieren.
Inzwischen ist Four Play eine der schönsten sex-positiven und kinky Partys in Berlin und bietet nicht nur ein kompromissloses musikalisches Lineup, sondern auch ein unglaublich reichhaltiges Programm an Performances und Workshops, bei denen unsere Gäste interagieren und ein aktiver Teil der Nacht werden können.

⫸⫸ WAS KANN MAN ERWARTEN ⫸⫸
▻ High-End Techno-Reise auf dem Main Floor, fröhliche moderne Interpretationen von House-Musik im Dragon Floor und Downtempo bis Soft-Tech im Keller.
▻ Rund 80 Performances, Walking Acts und Workshops.
▻ Ein kinky Marketplace, um eure Outfits zu optimieren.
▻ Hedonistischer Safe Space für Kinksters und LGTBQ.
▻ Ein großes, sehr engagiertes Awareness-Team.

FAQ
1. Können einzelne oder Gruppen von Hetero-Männern an der Party teilnehmen?
- Im Allgemeinen sind Frauen und Queers selten eine Bedrohung für ein sexpositives Konzept. Männer werden strenger ausgewählt und müssen nachweisen können, dass sie mit den Leitlinien des Konsens vertraut sind.
2. Sind normale Bade- oder Boxershorts genug?
- Nein, das sind sie nicht. Mit Bademode meinen wir sexy Bademode (ja, Männer, zeigt uns lieber eure Speedos).
3. Ist der übliche Kitkat oder Four Play Dresscode ausreichend?
- Ja, aber wir bitten dich, dich zu bemühen und dich an den farbenfrohen Charakter von Four Play anzupassen.
4. Darf ich vor Leuten oder spielenden Paaren masturbieren?
- Nein, das darfst du nicht. Solo-Wichser sind im Four Play nicht willkommen und werden ohne eindeutige Zustimmung als Belästigung angesehen.
5. Was tue ich, wenn ich oder jemand in meiner Umgebung sich unwohl fühlt oder misshandelt wird?
- Bitte melde das sofort unserem Awareness-Team. Du findest sie entweder in leuchtenden Westen im Club oder an der Awareness Station an der Pool Bar.",Section8,N/A

This party has been unique for more than 15 years and has become an integral part of Berlin's nightlife.

Today we celebrate the best band ever in a unique way as always. Here, in addition to related music, the legendary records of Depeche Mode will not only be played, but will be JOYED in dance and passionate play!

'Stripped', 'Freelove', 'Sea of Sin', 'A Pain that I'm used to' and 'Strangelove, etc'... all tracks that inspire more than just wild dancing. If you read the lyrics of the band carefully, you will be confronted again and again with the themes of sexuality, pain, love, sensuality and also perversions. But also other genre-like beats are not missed out.

So in this night electro sounds of the last decades meet whip cracking and sensual love play, when SM meets DM, Gothic meets Fetish and Oldschool meets Newschool.

This time this unique cocktail will be underlined by a very special fetish performance.

Musically DJ Marvin (Queen of the Night, Dark Friday) & DJ Toby (Black:Celebration) will not only make Depeche Mode fans happy, but will conjure up electro, goth rock, dark wave & 80ies on the dance floor.

This event is rounded off by video visuals of Depeche Mode and the atmospheric vaults of the INSOMNIA Club - all open from 10pm, including a whirlpool, massage bench, the gallery for couples hungry for experience and various game rooms, such as the BDSM catacombs in the basement.

2003775,Berlin,Ausland,Lychener Strasse 60; Prenzlauer Berg; 10437 Berlin; Germany,https://de.ra.co/clubs/21511,SOFIA BORGES / ILIA GOROVITZ / PEDRO MELO ALVES,2024-11-08,Fri 20:30,Fri 23:59,https://de.ra.co/events/2003775,wakabaandflorian,https://de.ra.co/promoters/150018,0,N/A,N/A,"Sofia Borges – drums, Ilia Gorovitz – drums , Pedro Melo Alves – drums",18,Experimental,"An evening as part of the biegungen im ausland consisting of three solo sets, which is entirely dedicated to a highly versatile instrument: the drums. 

Sofia Borges expands the possibilities of her instrument with everyday objects that you find in every hardware or household goods store: metal pieces, kitchen items, toys. The sound range that can be heard in her solo sets is as flexible as her instrument. With her free, open playing, she treats tempo as a variable, as one category among many, with no claim to dominance. Electronic sounds complement Borges’ lively percussion style.

Ilia Gorovitz has had a decisive influence on Berlin's artistic underground in just a few years. As an organizer with a sure sense of taste, Gorovitz presents exciting international acts from the fields of sonic experiments, noise and improvisation. Each program he is responsible for is an uncompromising manifesto. As a musician, Gorovitz is involved in various projects, including the minimal noise rock duo Stumpf and the bands PΞB and my blood is confusing. In his solo sets, the drummer shows his preference for complex rhythms and different degrees of distortion.

Sometimes delicate, sometimes powerful, always absolutely focused, this is how Pedro Melo Alves appears on stage. In his virtuosic live concerts, he gives the sounds enough space to unfold. Alves switches easily from contemplative soundscapes to complex, dense figures on the drums. The Portuguese musician and composer crafts amazing music from skins, rims, cymbals and objects at the highest technical level. His sets are like journeys of discovery through the sonic diversity of his instrument.

Gift is both a live performance and film created in parallel to Hamaguchi’s recent feature film Evil Does Not Exist – with both works using the same footage and scenario, yet applying a different approach. While Evil Does Not Exist was created as a classic feature film for cinematic release and won the Silver Lion at last year’s Venice International Film Festival, the companion piece Gift was crafted as a separate silent film meant for live soundtrack performance by Ishibashi. 

Written and directed by Ryūsuke Hamaguchi, Gift is set in Mizubiki Village in Nagano, a town located on a plateau rich in nature not so far from Tokyo. Takumi and his daughter Hana, who have lived there for generations, lead a modest life, following the cycle of nature. Their small community is increasingly challenged by a steady flow of new arrivals. One day, a plan is hatched by an entertainment agency to build a glamping site near Takumi’s house. The discovery that they intend to discharge sewage into the village water source causes unrest in the village, disrupting the community’s calm way of life. 

A counterpart to Evil Does Not Exist, Gift offers an alternative perspective on disharmony and inevitable imbalances in man’s relationship to nature by using the same material and story, but creating a distinct, emotionally charged experience enhanced through Ishibashi’s live performance.",CTM,"https://hebbel-am-ufer-tickets.reservix.de/p/reservix/event/2291463?_locale=de, https://www.ctm-festival.de/"

Champagne & Naughtyness
Whether it's the 1920s or the 2020s, we lived and still live in turbulent times. INSOMNIA is a melting pot of dreams and hopes between crises, wars and conflicts.

We dance through the night on the volcano of desire, shrill, fast, radical, excessive, exalted and wicked. We transform heaviness into lightness, break the corsets of convention and immerse ourselves in a world of sparkling encounters and mischief.

Be brave. Be wild. Be irresistible.

Dress code:
Nothing normal. Don't dress up - reinvent yourself! It's time to unleash your true essence. Be sexy, extravagant, kinky - be a feast for the senses.

Create looks that whisper, scream and seduce. Let leather meet lace, shine meet darkness, fetish meet baroque and create an outfit that says more about you than words ever could.

Rules? Only those that honor freedom and respect. Always ask, dance wildly, play beautifully.

Respect and active consent come first. Ask politely if you want to talk, dance or play with someone, respect a 'no' the first time and thank them for it. Remember that a public game is not an automatic invitation to join in. Our awareness team, recognizable by the glowing crowns, will be out and about for you all night.

No ""free-range"" photographer! We have a permanent photo station in the clinic corner from 10pm to 1am for those who want to take photos.

On this night, you are the masterpieces, the sculptures that glow in the dark. Under the flickering light of the lasers and the rich sound of techno, each of you is a living work of art, unique and desirable.

Birds of paradise, the curious and greedy for the new, eccentric nightshade plants populate the bizarre amusement as phantasmagorias - ""Schampus & Schabernack"" offers space for everyone who wants to dance in the shadows and shine in the spotlight.

LIN ist mehr als eine Solokünstler*in, LIN ist eine Soloband. Aus Fußschaltern, Kabeln, Loop-Station und ihren Instrumenten hat die Berlinerin ein Cockpit für Konzerte gebaut, mit dem sie einen beeindruckenden Sound kreiert. Genretechnisch irgendwo zwischen Elektro- und Popsphäre, vielschichtig, detailreich und intensiv. Die englischsprachigen Songs sind nicht nur tanzbar, sondern auch ausdrücklich politisch. In ihren Texten inszeniert die queere Künstler*in eine Welt, in der gesellschaftlich gemachte Normen aufgebrochen und neu gesetzt werden. ""We need new norms"" fordert LIN. Bei ihren Liveshows reißt sie das Publikum förmlich mit, wie der Impuls einer Kugelwelle, bei der sich die Energie in immer größeren Kreisen ausbreitet.

Für diese Veranstaltung bieten wir ermäßigte Tickets an, um auch Menschen mit kleinerem Portmonee Zugang zu Kultur zu ermöglichen. Diese Kontingente sind limitiert und nur bei TixforGigs verfügbar. Wir vertrauen auf Eure Selbsteinschätzung: Wenn ihr könnt, bucht Standard-Tickets und überlasst die ermäßigten Kontingente denjenigen, die gerade sehr sparen müssen.

Five in One. Drums, synthesizer, guitar, bass and vocals.
LIN is more than a solo artist, LIN is a solo band. From footswitches, cables, loop station and instruments she has built a cockpit for concerts, with which she creates a sound that navigates genre-wise between electro and pop spheres. Multi-layered, rich in detail and intense. The English-language songs are not only danceable, but also explicitly political. In her lyrics, the queer artist* stages a world in which socially made norms are broken and set anew. “We need new norms” demands LIN. At her live shows, she literally sweeps the audience along, like the momentum of a spherical wave in which the energy spreads in ever larger circles.

For this event we offer discounted tickets to give people with less money still access to culture. These quotas are limited and only available at TixforGigs. We trust in your self-assessment: If you can, please book standard tickets and leave the reduced tickets to those who have to save money at the moment.

Mabe Fratti’s sensibility is the triumph of experimentation over technical dominion of an instrument. The experimentation of sound with feelings, with existence itself, with an open heart, letting herself to be transformed by what she lives and hears. This is what has led Mabe Fratti from Guatemala to Mexico City. From the creation of pop songs to free improvisation, from the academy to noise, from collaborations in ensembles and duos to the profound personal journey that is reflected in her solo works.
Military Genius (songwriter/producer Bryce Cloghesy) announced his new album, Scarred For Life, set to release on November 1st, 2024 via Unheard of Hope. Following his 2020 debut Deep Web, this album blends bass-heavy R&B, spaced dub, and jazz with a more traditional rock influence, focusing on lyricism. The lead single Darkest Hour, accompanied by a self-directed video shot near his new home in Joshua Tree, California, captures the feeling of being swept into the unknown. Cloghesy reflects on leaving the past behind and embracing the journey into an uncertain future.",silent-green,"https://www.silent-green.net/en/programme/detail/2024/11/11/mabe-fratti, https://www.eventbrite.de/e/mabe-fratti-tickets-922975864657?fbclid=IwY2xjawEizOxleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHTaN8bHhqFYimPBoZp092H6YcjJ7hV8cfCwJ9D9iA2E7or749QsuC0wr7g_aem_fnAcFGJp4_8Sp2U-YJPQNw"

The most recent was the powerful, emotional, abysmal ""Filthy Underneath"" in February, which shows her lyrically and musically on top of her game. She even deals with topics such as her own experiences of sexual abuse, depression and suicidal thoughts in songs that should appeal to anyone who loves PJ Harvey, Nick Cave, Marianne Faithfull and Chelsea Wolfe. Shah, who has Norwegian and Pakistani roots and was raised in England, says: ""I feel far less restricted than ever before when writing lyrics and making music. There's something extremely liberating about people knowing your most intimate story. I will never be able to be a secretive artist. It's too late for that. But maybe some of my story will speak to the listener.""

The fact that she adds a ""maybe"" here can be read as a British understatement, because you can see just how much she does this at her intense concerts - and there will be a few of them in November. She will be performing live in four German cities from November 8th.

Jeden Dienstag ab 18:00 Uhr. Seit inzwischen mehr als 10 Jahren ist der Dienstag mit ""Open Decks & Tischtennis"" im Humboldthain Club eine feste Instanz für Nordberliner Bewegungsjunkies. 

Ob die Platten zum Auflegen, die Kellen fürs Tischtennis oder die Ballerinas für den Floor – jeden Dienstag könnt ihr euer Spielzeug mitbringen und vom Wochenende entschlacken. 
Ob Techno, Drum and Bass, Disco oder Mamas Schlagersammlung – jeder Stil ist willkommen und wird vom Publikum abgefeiert. 

Daher bietet der ""Open Decks Abend"" vielen jungen DJs eine nach wie vor einzigartige Plattform zur Darbietung ihrer Künste und zum Austausch untereinander. 

Zwei Tischtennisplatten, genug Kellen für alle, ein Kickertisch, satter Sound aus den Boxen und nicht zuletzt leckeres Bier vom Fass, tragen dazu bei, dass eine stetig wachsende Zahl an gut gelaunten Menschen den Dienstag im Humboldthain Club zu ihrer Homebase erklärt hat. 

FAQ Frage: Wie läuft das mit dem Auflegen? 
Antwort: Zu Beginn jeder Veranstaltung liegt an der Mainbar eine Liste mit den DJ-Slots für den Abend aus. 

Jeder Slot geht eine halbe Stunde und jeder DJ darf nur einen (seinen) Namen in die Liste eintragen. 
Pro Abend gibt es 20 Slots!

The band's line-up is in constant flux; there can be anywhere between 1 and 20 members on a recording.

The Telescopes have influenced the shoegaze, space rock and neo-psychedelic movement including artists such as The Brian Jonestown Massacre, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Füxa, The Warlocks, Revolver, Whipping Boy, Vanishing Lines, Seefeel, Ecstasy of Saint Theresa, Frances Bean Cobain, Portishead, Mogwai and Radiohead.

In recognition of their ongoing influence on a new generation of artists, a tribute compilation titled Anticipating Nowhere, A Homage To The Telescopes was released in 2016 by The Blog That Celebrates Itself Records. The album featured 17 Telescopes tracks covered by various artists from the Flavor Crystals, Jaguwar and One Unique Signal.

The Telescopes have been described by the British music press as ""more a revolution of the psyche than a revolution of the sidewalk""; a thread consistent throughout a body of work spanning over 30 years.

The band has released 16 studio albums across various music labels including but not limited to Creation Records and Tapete Records with their most recent album Growing Eyes Become String out now on Fuzz Club Records. A new album is currently being recorded for Tapete.

As a live band, they are considered to be unique even in their niche, with positive reviews from publications such as Isolation (UK), ""The Telescopes are such an important band. Such an important concept. They walk where other bands fear to tread and refuse to compromise their art. This is what makes them so vital on record and unmissable on stage.""


Supporting act:

angelic milk (DE)

Berlin-based band that has captivated audiences worldwide with their unique blend of dreamy bedroom pop and raw garage rock. Formed in St. Petersburg in 2014, the band quickly gained a devoted following, earning praise for their catchy tunes and evocative performances. Fronted by the charming anti-heroine Sarah Persephona, their music is characterized by electrifying melodies and nostalgic sound. The lyrics are telling tales of fatal romance, psychedelic experiences and old school rock’n’roll lifestyle, and the band’s live shows are a notoriously loud and chaotic spectacle with a twist of wild sex appeal.

Originally hailing from Manchester, the duo have taken their dark and drum-inflected sound to the furthest reaches of the electronic music scene, often transcending club culture and branching into experimental concerts and festivals.

For our next session of 180 min w/  we are super excited to welcome the pair to our historic Saal for a night of unbridled atmospheric experimentation as they perform a rare 3-hour live set accompanied by a spellbinding light show from Mike Erwin. If you’ve been following the series (which has already seen the likes of Rrose, .VRIL and Rødhäd) you know to expect the unexpected.

Supporting Demdike Stare on the night will be the supremely talented Gizem Öz. Renowned for her roles as a sound artist, contemporary artist, DJ and producer, her ambient sets create cohesive sonic narratives that continue to resonate long after the music ends.

Danceable melancholy, you could say. Stylistically, Trentemøller interweaves electro with shoegaze, synth and dreampop, sometimes instrumental, sometimes with hand-picked guest singers. His most recent album, ""Memoria"", was released in 2022 and features new wave influences in songs such as ""Dead Or Alive"" and ""No More Kissing In The Rain"". This time around, more than half of the tracks on the record are purely instrumental. In an interview, Trentemøller said: ""I'm still a big fan of instrumental music. It's such a beautiful way of expressing feelings. Straight to the heart without restrictions. And my music has that
cinematic approach that instrumental music also has.""

His live concerts are particularly inspiring because Trentemøller not only relies on atmospheric lighting and visuals, but performs together with a band that will bring the nuances of his music with precision to the stage. On his new tour, which will also take him to Munich, Berlin and Cologne starting in mid-November, he will be joined by Disa Jakobs (vocals, guitar, synths), Silas Tinglef (drums, guitar), Brian Batz (guitar), Jacob Haubjerg (bass) and, of course, the mastermind behind it all: Anders Trentemøller on synths.

In the realm of lucid dreaming, where the shadows play,
We gather for an event, let the night lead the way.
With the pulse of drum and bass, hearts begin to race,
Awareness blooms like fireflies, illuminating space.

Dancing through the cosmos, lost in the sound,
In this vibrant tapestry, we are truly unbound.
Feel the rhythm in our souls, let the music embrace,
In the magic of the moment, we find our rightful place.

So let’s drift on this journey, where dreams intertwine,
In the dance of awareness, we’ll forever shine.

Mit WNBL invites haben sie seit Beginn des Jahres eine Residency im Gretchen. Dabei gehört es zu ihrer sich ständig weiterentwickelnden Herangehensweise an Musik, dass sie regelmäßig Künstler*innen einladen, um musikalische Erfahrungsräume zu gestalten.

Kota No Uta ist eine in Berlin lebende Künstlerin, Produzentin und Singer-Songwriterin. Ihr Sound ist im Neo-Soul und psychedelischen Soul verwurzelt und reicht von afrikanischer Musik bis hin zu experimentellen und elektronischen Klängen. Als multikulturelle Geschichtenerzählerin schreibt Kota ihre Texte durch das Prisma von Metaphern und Mythologie, oft inspiriert durch tägliche Beobachtungen ihrer Umgebung. Ihr Markenzeichen ist die kraftvolle, dunkel gefärbte Stimme, die sie in ihren selbst produzierten Songs gerne mehrfach aufnimmt und übereinanderlegt. Kota No Uta setzt bewusst auf Kontraste und kreiert dadurch immer wieder überraschende Momente.

Im Jahr 2023 gewann Kota einen Female* Producer Prize von Sony Music Entertainment Germany und Music Woman.

WNBL selbst kommen wieder mit einer druckvollen Bläsersektion und einer Rhythmusgruppe, die aus zwei Schlagzeugern besteht. Alle Beteiligten sind musikalisch in der Berliner Clubkultur sozialisiert, alle hören Dub, Bass Music und Broken Beats. Möglicherweise ist das der Grund, warum sie ihre Jazz-Skills niemals raushängen lassen. Stattdessen nehmen sie den Jazz beim Wort und spielen beeindruckende Live-Sets mit cleveren Beats, Improvisationen und wunderbaren Arrangements.

DJ Alkarline, deren Name inspiriert ist von der Alakali-Mangan-Zelle, umgangssprachlich auch Alkaline oder Alkali-Mangan-Batterie bezeichnet, sorgt dafür, dass die Energiespeicher den ganzen Abend mit groovy Electronica aufgeladen bleiben.

Für diese Veranstaltung bieten wir ermäßigte Tickets an, um auch Menschen mit kleinerem Portmonee Zugang zu Kultur zu ermöglichen. Diese Kontingente sind limitiert und nur bei TixforGigs verfügbar. Wir vertrauen auf Eure Selbsteinschätzung: Wenn ihr könnt, bucht Standard-Tickets und überlasst die ermäßigten Kontingente denjenigen, die gerade sehr sparen müssen.

WNBL is a collective of nine young musicians based in Berlin and Potsdam, who bring an unique blend of influences from electronic music, jazz and hiphop with a matchless energy onto the stage. With “WNBL invites”, they have a residency at Gretchen. As part of their constantly evolving approach to music, they invite artists to create spaces for musical experiences.

Kota No Uta is a Berlin based artist, producer and singer-songwriter. Her experimental sound is rooted in neo-soul, psychedelic soul. A multicultural story teller, by nature, Kota writes her lyrics through the prism of metaphor and mythology, often inspired by daily observations of surroundings. In 2023 Kota won a Female* Producer Prize by Sony Music Entertainment Germany and Music Woman, meanwhile releasing collaborative singles with various producers.

WNBL themselves come with a powerful brass section and a rhythm section consisting of two drummers. All those involved are musically socialised in Berlin's club culture, they all listen to dub, bass music and broken beats. they take jazz at its word and play impressive live sets with ecstatic beats, exciting improvisation and wonderful arrangements.

DJ Alkarline, whose name is inspired by the alakali-manganese cell, also known colloquially as an alkaline or alkali-manganese battery, ensures that the energy stores remain charged throughout the evening with groovy electronica.

In their live performance, the sculptor Le_haekien and the sound artist Veith von Tsotzhousn work with the same sound material. This unfolds in space and makes movement visible. A fusion of sound and the medium of wood emerges—a relationship that absorbs, amplifies, and simultaneously alters different qualities of time to release them into the space. In this sonic and sculptural work, a dialogue arises, manifesting in a walkable sound space. The two artists invite the audience to linger in the multi-hour performance, observing the evolving space and immersing themselves in the ever-changing sound.

In ihrer Live Performance arbeiten der Bildhauer Le_haekien und der Soundkünstler Veith von Tsotzhousn mit demselben Klangmaterial. Dieses entfaltet sich im Raum und macht Bewegung sichtbar. Eine Fusion aus Klang und dem Medium Holz entsteht. Eine Beziehung, die verschiedene Zeitqualitäten aufnimmt, verstärkt und zugleich verändert, um diese in den Raum zu entlassen. In dieser klanglichen und skulpturalen Arbeit entsteht ein Dialog, der sich in einem begehbaren Klangraum manifestiert. Die beiden Künstler laden dazu ein, in der mehrstündigen Performance zu verweilen, die Entwicklung im Raum zu beobachten und sich dem sich stetig verändernden Klang hinzugeben.",five,"Http://www.dasplateau.de, https://www.instagram.com/le_haekien?igsh=NndwcDdxcXo1N2lx"

Stella Rose introduced her debut album Eyes of Glass in 2023 on the heels of two well-received singles, Muddled Man and Angel (GR), establishing her as a poetic force and powerful singer. “Passionate and dissolute, Muddled Man recalls Nick Cave at his Biblical best” (Clash). Its opposing reflection, Angel with “warm, folksy croon swells into a room-filling climax” (Paper Magazine). Eyes of Glass, recorded in Los Angeles and produced by Yves Rothman, combines the poetic soul of Stella Rose’s lyrics with the serpentine sound she and Rothman have developed – feeling like a piece in conversation with its artistic predecessors.


Quarters of Change
Anchored by a mutual predisposition for unpredictability, Quarters of Change fuse together a signature hybrid of nineties-style alternative hooks, crunchy space rock soundscapes, and strutting seventies grooves. The New York City quartet of Ben Acker (guitar, bass, synthesiser), Attila Anrather (drums), Jasper Harris (guitar, bass, synthesiser) and Ben Roter (vocals, guitar) crafts a rich exhibition of emotion on their aptly titled 2023 second full-length offering, Portraits (300 Entertainment).

Aki Himanen & Aleksi Kinnunen - Live (Trumpet, Electronica, Drums, Fx):

Trumpeter Aki Himanen and drummer Aleksi Kinnunen form an explosive duo that fuses Scandinavian jazz with the pulsating rhythms of techno music. They are constantly searching for new ways in which man and machine can create a real dialogue. Improvisation, spontaneity and musical communication are at the heart of their work.
The music is dark, intense and a poetic mix full of hypnotic mental images. It is reminiscent of Scandinavian landscapes where nature and technology gently merge. A suspenseful night drive somewhere between futuristic mountains where dawn is setting and darkness fades away in a slow and wonderful way.

Gianluca Petrella (DJ Set):

Gianluca Petrella is a jazz trombonist who has collaborated with internationally renowned musicians such as Enrico Rava, Carla Bley, and Steve Coleman. His career has included performances at major festivals and collaborations with prominent jazz figures.

Petrella is also very active in the field of electronic music. He has worked with artists like Ricardo Villalobos and Max Loderbauer on the Re: ECM project and with Moritz von Oswald. He has collaborated with electronic groups such as ""9lazy9"" and ""Matmos"" and has explored new musical territories with DJs Nicola Conte and Ralf.

For this very special performance, Gianluca will debut at Kantine Am Berghain selecting his vinyl collection of black music and deep house.

Jazz-O-Tech is a label that draws on the rich heritage of two of music's most visionary and experimental genres: jazz and techno.

Mit Einflüssen aus der dänischen Volksmusik und skandinavischem Jazz, darunter Nils Frahm, Esbjörn Svennson und Jan Johanssons Aufnahme “Jazz På Svenska“, ist ihre Musik eine exquisite und fröhliche Verschmelzung von schönen Melodien, zartem Minimalismus, eingängigen Grooves, subtilen elektronischen Vibes, nordischen Atmosphären und organischem Zusammenspiel –  alles getragen von der reinen Freude am gemeinsamen Spiel.

Ihre Musik ist auf den ersten Blick einfach gehalten, entwickelt und entfaltet sich aber beim Hören, mit viel Raum für Erkundung, Reflexion und Improvisation. Ihr Ziel ist es, Musik zu schaffen, die so ehrlich und intim wie möglich ist, “mit Melodien und Rhythmen, die so stark sind, dass wir nur noch die Überbringer sind”, wie sie sagen. Und ihre ausgezeichnete musikalische Chemie erlaubt es ihnen, sich wenig Gedanken über musikalische Einflüsse zu machen. Das verleiht ihrer Musik einen fesselnden Charme.

Svaneborg Kardyb stammen aus Aalborg in Jütland, im Norden Dänemarks, wo sie sich 2013 begegneten. Sechs Jahre später fingen sie an gemeinsam Musik zu machen. Wie ihre neuen Labelkollegen Vega Trails sind Svaneborg Kardyb ein Duo, ein Format, das ihnen viel Raum gibt, den sie besetzen – oder auch leer lassen können.

Svaneborg Kardyb haben bei den Danish Music Awards Jazz 2019 gleich zwei Preise gewonnen: New Artist of the Year und Composer of the Year. Bisher haben sie drei Studioalben veröffentlicht: Knob (2019), Haven (2020) und Over Tage (2022) sowie die Veröffentlichung der At Home (An NPR Tiny Desk Session) EP (2023). Die Tiny Desk Session schaffte den internationalen Durchbruch und seitdem ist die Band in 13 verschiedenen Ländern ausgiebig getourt. Glücklicherweise haben sie die Zeit gefunden, ihr viertes Album aufzunehmen, das im Herbst 2024 auf Gondwana Records erscheinen wird.

Sein Klavierspiel zeichnet sich durch eine beeindruckende Mischung aus technischer Brillanz, melodischer Sensibilität und kreativer Spontaneität aus. Taylor Eigsti ist in der Lage, musikalische Geschichten in Echtzeit zu erzählen und dabei innovative melodische und harmonische Wendungen zu entwickeln.

Anfang des Jahres erschien sein neuestes Album “Plot Armor“, ein abwechslungsreiches und reich instrumentiertes Album voller stilistischer Wendungen, aufgenommen mit absoluten Stars des amerikanischen Jazz, darunter der Saxophonist Ben Wendel und der Ausnahmegitarrist Julian Lage, die beide schon bei uns im Gretchen aufgetreten sind. Für seine Europatournee hat Taylor Eigsti ebenfalls ein Starensemble zusammengestellt, darunter die Sängerin Gretchen Parlato, sowie Casey Abrams und Ben Wendel, der auf diesem Weg auch wieder zu uns kommt. Klingt wie gemacht für unser Gretchen.

Taylor Eigstis Biografie liest sich wie die Geschichte eines Wunderkindes: Mit vier Jahren begann er Klavier zu spielen, mit acht Jahren hatte er seinen ersten öffentlichen Auftritt im Vorprogramm von David Benoit, mit vierzehn veröffentlichte er sein erstes Album. Seitdem feiert er Erfolge als Solokünstler und als Begleiter großer Pop- und Jazzkünstler*innen, von John Mayer und Sting bis zu Dave Brubeck, Esperanza Spalding und Joshua Redman. “Plot Armor“ erschien auf GroundUp Records, dem Label von Snarky Puppy-Frontmann Michael League.

Die argentinische Sängerin La Yegros kommt aus Buenos Aires, dort klingen die Nächte nach Dancehall und elektronischen Bässen, ihre Eltern jedoch stammen aus Misiones, einer Provinz an der Grenze zu Brasilien und Paraguay, wo die Bälle mit den Klängen von Chamamé, Carnavalito und kolumbianischem Cumbia gefüllt sind. Diese Einflüsse sind von ihr auf mittlerweile drei Alben verschmolzen und zu einer speziellen Version von Nu-Cumbia entwickelt worden.

Jetzt ist es Zeit es für ein neues Repertoire. Ihr neues und inzwischen viertes Album “Haz“ hat La Yegros mit dem Team aufgenommen, das bereits für ihr erstes Album “Viene de Mí“ verantwortlich war: Produzent King Coya, ein Pionier der synthetischen Experimente in der traditionellen Musik und der Komponist Daniel Martín, der es versteht, Melodien zum Träumen und Hymnen zum Mitsingen zu erfinden.

Für La Yegros geht es nicht darum, immer das gleiche zu machen und vorgefundene Klänge zu reproduzieren. Sie erfindet ihre eigene Folklore, indem sie neue Rhythmen zusammenstellt und mit Fagott, Querflöte und Flamenco-Gitarre originelle Klänge integriert, während die urbanen Elemente die Tanzflächen mit Anklängen an Reggae und Funk auf den Kopf stellen. Dabei entwirft sie ihre Alben immer mit Blick auf die Live-Präsentation. Uns erwartet eine fantastische Mischung, in der akustische Instrumente auf Samples, Synthesizer und live gespielte Electronica treffen.

Für diese Veranstaltung bieten wir ermäßigte Tickets an, um auch Menschen mit kleinerem Portmonee Zugang zu Kultur zu ermöglichen. Diese Kontingente sind limitiert und nur bei TixforGigs verfügbar.

____________________________________________


La Yegros returned to the stage in 2022 to celebrate an anniversary: the 10th anniversary of Viene de Mí, her hit from the album of the same name, released worldwide in 2013, which catapulted her to international fame. We discovered a singer as rooted in the traditions of her country as she is in the most contemporary trends. Her parents come from Misiones, a province bordering Brazil and Paraguay, where balls are filled with the sounds of Chamamé, Carnavalito and Colombian cumbia. But she herself is a native of Buenos Aires, whose nights are alive with the dancehall and electronic bass.

These influences have fused in two further successful albums, Magnetismo (2016) and Suelta (2019), followed by whirlwind tours during which La Yegros has been able to display her generous nature, inexhaustible energy, exuberant personality and infectious enthusiasm. La Yegros relaunched its dance machine in front of audiences as wild as ever, with a tried and tested repertoire that no dancer can resist. But it was also time for a new repertoire. To record their fourth album, La Yegros put her trust in a winning team, already responsible for Viene de Mí. On the one hand, producer King Coya (Gaby Kerpel), a pioneer of synthetic experimentation applied to traditional music. On the other, composer Daniel Martín, who knows how to come up with melodies to dream about and hymns to sing along to. Inseparable and complementary, the trio continue to concoct this fantastic mixture where acoustic instruments meet samples and the rolling of machines.

But La Yegros, crowned queen of Nu-Cumbia, has never rested on her laurels. Her new productions continue to draw on popular music, but they are breaking away from over-defined genres. La Yegros invents her own folklore by knitting together new rhythms and integratng original sounds (bassoon, transverse flute, flamenco guitar, etc.), while the urban elements promise to turn dancefloors upside down with echoes of reggae and funk.

La Yegros never conceives an album without imagining how it will perform live. And although her show is a benchmark for the venues and festivals, she went into residency to beef up her formula. In additon to her usual line-up of guitar, accordion and percussion, a musician handles synthesizers and machines to play all the electronic elements live – a risk-taker as much as a doubling of possibilities. In any case, you can count on the singer to assert her increasingly clear-cut character with each new project. And, above all, to never give up. La Yegros is back and her batteries are fully charged!

Ihre Musik ist rau, akustisch und progressiv, kontrastiert fröhlich Stile und Genres und ist viel zu wendig, um sich kategorisieren zu lassen. In klassischer Jazztrio-Besetzung (Piano, Bass und Schlagzeug) gehen Shalosh ihren eigenen Weg und schaffen eine einzigartige und faszinierende Synthese aus so unterschiedlichen Einflüssen wie Jazz, Rock, Klassik, Electronica, afrikanischer und nahöstlicher Musik.

Im letzten Jahr ist “Tales of Utopia“ erschienen. Ein Album, das während der Covid-Pandemie entstand und sich inmitten chaotisch gewordener Zeitläufte einer friedlichen Utopie widmet. „Wir hatten die Zeit, uns mit unserer Herkunft zu beschäftigen. Wir lasen Geschichten aus der Bibel oder aus Tausendundeiner Nacht und vielen anderen Mythologien“, sagt Pianist Gadi. Und wieder sind es der eingängige Groove und die ausgeprägte Melodik, gepaart mit einem ausgeprägten Storytelling, die den typischen Shalosh-Sound definieren. Aufgenommen unter Live-Bedingungen, ohne Kopfhörer und Verstärker, ist hier eine ganz eigene, raue und eindringliche Dynamik entstanden.

Das Trio interagiert auf höchstem Niveau und kommt ohne instrumentale Schauläufe oder melodische Dominanz aus. Diese Ausgewogenheit erreichen sie durch einen einfachen Kniff: Das Ensemble wird nicht von einem Leader geführt, sondern alle drei sind gleichberechtigt beteiligt. So können sie ihre gemeinsame künstlerische Entwicklung genießen und Musik ohne Ego entwerfen. Shalosh schaffen virtuos den Spagat, sich selbst als Musiker und Künstler herauszufordern und gleichzeitig zugängliche und anspruchsvolle Musik für ein breites Publikum zu machen.

Die Geschichte von Shalosh begann in Jerusalem, wo Matan Assayag (Schlagzeug) und Gadi Stern (Klavier) die Band “Enoma Elish“ gründeten. Nach der Auflösung der Band setzten die beiden ihre musikalische Partnerschaft zwischen Israel und New York, wo Gadi damals lebte, fort. Anfang 2014 beschlossen sie, Shalosh zu gründen und engagierten den Bassisten David Michaeli. Seit der Veröffentlichung ihres Debütalbums „The Bell Garden“ im Jahr 2014 haben sie in der internationalen Musikszene tiefe Spuren hinterlassen.

Für diese Veranstaltung bieten wir ermäßigte Tickets an, um auch Menschen mit kleinerem Portmonee Zugang zu Kultur zu ermöglichen. Diese Kontingente sind limitiert und nur bei TixforGigs verfügbar. Wir vertrauen auf Eure Selbsteinschätzung: Wenn ihr könnt, bucht Standard-Tickets und überlasst die ermäßigten Kontingente denjenigen, die gerade sehr sparen müssen.

____________________________________


SHALOSH is an instrumental piano trio, that belongs to the current generation of cross genre jazz groups able to reach a wide spectrum of audiences, in the Jazz world as well as in other genres. Their music is raw, acoustic and progressive, crossing stylistic boundaries and defying definition.

Despite its classic jazz trio format (piano, bass and drums) and the band members’ deep roots in jazz and improvised music, SHALOSH’s music weaves its own path and creates a unique and fascinating synthesis out of such varied genres as Rock, Classical, Electronic, African, and Middle Eastern music.

SHALOSH has set itself the goal of creating music that is both accessible and sophisticated, performing with great alacrity the balancing act of challenging themselves as musicians and artists, while leaving the door open for as wide an audience as possible, striving to break the distance screen that intellectual music may create. Their music comes from an emotional and raw place, the band’s reaction to today’s cold urban jungle.

For this event we offer discounted tickets to give people with less money still access to culture. These quotas are limited and only available at TixforGigs. We trust in your self-assessment: If you can, please book standard tickets and leave the reduced tickets to those who have to save money at the moment.

Ihre elektronische Musik ist geprägt von Field-Recordings der Natur und eignet sich sowohl für die Tanzfläche als auch für eine entspannte Umgebung. Jeder einzelne Track von Gidge schafft seine eigene Atmosphäre und Emotion. Ihr Werk entwickelt sich auf natürliche Weise und baut sich oft aus einem ruhigen Break, der mit Vocal-Samples und neoklassischen Einflüssen verfeinert wird, zu kraftvollen Höhepunkten auf. 

 

Die Musik von Gidge, die für ihre Inspiration aus dem Wald, der Natur und dem Norden Schwedens bewundert wird, ist in der Tat von absolut internationalem Kaliber und wird von Menschen aus der ganzen Welt gehört. Gidge haben auf ihrer Clubtournee in London, Amsterdam, Paris und Stockholm ausverkauft und auf Festivals in Mexiko, Georgien, der Türkei und Thailand ihr Live-Set vor großem Publikum gespielt. Blogs wie Pigeons & Planes, A Closer Listen und Ransom Note schrieben über ihre Musik - Pitchfork-Mitarbeiter wählten Gidge zu ihren Lieblingskünstlern, die sie an verschneiten Tagen hören wollten - XLR8R-Leser wählten Gidge 2015 auf Platz 1 der „besten neuen elektronischen Acts"" - Bandcamp hob „LNLNN"" 2017 als „Album des Tages"" hervor.  

 

Die Diskografie von Gidge umfasst das Album „Autumn Bells"", den Kurzfilm „Lulin"" (in Zusammenarbeit mit Lampray), das Minialbum „LNLNN"" und die Debüt-EP „For Seoul"". Am 6. November 2021 erschien ihr neuestes Album „New Light"", das ebenfalls von der Kritik gelobt wurde.

Over the past twenty years, she has been developing solo music based on the pitches of the open strings intended to accentuate the natural sympathetic resonances of her particularly loud viola. Although her primary training was in classical music, Jessica Pavone has dedicated her practice to exploring alternative avenues for creative musical expression and “has made a career of redefining the possibilities for her instrument” (Steve Smith, National Sawdust Log). Recently What Happens Has Become Now has been released, Jessica Pavone’s fifth solo viola album and her fourth for Relative Pitch Records.

Keisuke Matsuno is a guitarist who employs sound processing techniques, including live sampling, controlled feedback, and real-time manipulation. Born and raised in Berlin, he later relocated to Brooklyn, where he has spent a decade honing his craft. Keisuke Matsuno has been part of Jim Black's band for nearly 10 years, working on music ranging from John Zorn to Hildur Guðnadóttir, collaborated on improvisational sets with Andrea Parkins, and recently joined Evi Filippou's band. For this performance, the four join forces to deliver an explosive set that fuses their individual influences into a unique blend of glitch, cut-and-paste, noise, and ambient.

Das Wort „àbáse“ stammt aus der westafrikanischen Yoruba-Sprache und steht für Zusammenarbeit: für kollektive Anstrengungen, Kollaborationen und einen gemeinschaftlichen Vibe. Als Ideengeber dieses Projekts bringt Bognár Szabolcs Künstler*innen zusammen, um in kollaborativer Arbeit einen Sound entstehen zu lassen, der traditionelle westafrikanische und afro-brasilianische Musik mit Jazz, Hip-Hop und Clubkultur verbindet.

In diesem Jahr ist mit “Awakening“ das zweite Album von À‎báse erschienen. Das Album wurde in vier Tagen in den Berliner Brewery Studios mit einem Ensemble aus engen Mitarbeiter*innen aufgenommen und vereint Àbáses vielfältige musikalische Einflüsse und Bezugspunkte (klassischer Lagos Afrobeat, traditionelle ungarische Folklore, Yoruba-Rhythmen, House und Techno, Hip-Hop und vieles mehr.) mit der exquisiten modalen Improvisation, die durch Szabis Selbstbeobachtung angeregt wird.

Nachdem er bereits von BBC Radio 6 Music's Gilles Peterson, Soulection, Okayplayer, Worldwide FM, Stamp The Wax, Earmilk, Complex und KEXP unterstützt wurde, veröffentlichte Àbáse 2019 seine lang erwartete Debüt-EP „Invocation“ über HHV Records und Cosmic Compositions und Anfang 2021 die „Body Mind Spirit“ EP, eine gemeinsame elektronische Erkundung mit dem Schlagzeuger/Produzenten Ziggy Zeitgeist. Ende 2021 erschien das gefeierte Debütalbum „Laroyê“, das komplett während einer fünfmonatigen Reise nach Brasilien aufgenommen wurde und dem Projekt weltweite Anerkennung einbrachte.

Als ausgebildeter Keyboarder ist Bognár seit vielen Jahren in der vielseitigen Musikszene von Budapest aktiv. Er hat mehrere erfolgreiche Acts geleitet, darunter Solqlap Budapest und The Mabon Dawud Republic, ein vierzehnköpfiges Afrobeat-Orchester, das die Felabration Budapest veranstaltete und mit Künstlern wie Dele Sosimi und Pat Thomas auftrat. Nach Aufenthalten in Paris, Lyon, New York, Accra, Rio de Janeiro und Salvador lebt Bognár heute in Berlin, wo er neben seiner Solokarriere auch als Keyboarder für den nigerianischen Soulsänger Wayne Snow, das lokale Kollektiv Sonic Interventions und den australischen Jazz-Schlagzeuger Ziggy Zeitgeist's Zeitgeist Freedom Energy Exchange arbeitet. Sein Engagement in der internationalen Musikszene führte zu Studio- oder Bühnenkooperationen mit so unterschiedlichen Künstlern wie Immanuel Wilkins, Elzhi, Guilty Simpson, Phat Kat, Etuk Ubong, Moses Yoofee, Petter Eldh oder Patti Smith.

_____________________________________


On a quest for cosmic grooves of unity, Àbáse is the imagination of Hungarian producer and keyboardist Szabolcs Bognár. Creating an exquisite blend of jazz, West African, Brazilian, hip-hop and electronic music, he set to release his second album ‘Awakening’ in collaboration with Analogue Foundation in summer 2024.

Created following a move to Berlin, marriage, new parenthood, and the inevitable interrogation of mortality that takes place when a loved one has transitioned, the album demonstrates a deep understanding of music’s ability to cross time and geographic boundaries, conveying a message of unity, dialogue and self-reflection.

Recorded in four days at Berlin's Brewery Studios with an ensemble of close collaborators, the album coalesces Àbáse’s varied musical influences and reference points (classic Lagos Afrobeat, traditional Hungarian folk, Yoruba rhythms, house and techno, hip-hop et al) with the exquisite modal improvisation spurred by Szabi’s introspection. His work as an artist has drawn widespread critical acclaim. Debut album ‘Laroyê, recorded entirely during a five- month trip to Brazil, found global praise from the likes of The Guardian, BBC Radio 6, Selection, KEXP and Complex. As a keyboard player, Szabi has collaborated with the likes of Wayne Snow, Dele Sosimi, Pat Thomas and Zeitgeist Freedom Energy Exchange.

The harmonics, rhythmic textures and buffeting decay conjure the sense of a monumental sound rig playing at earth-shaking volume—capable of displacing huge volumes of atmosphere, yet with barely a kick or a snare in sight.

Ever-evolving, Behrooz Moosavi’s music lurks uneasily through the grimy pummel of rhythmic noise, woozy ambience and mind-warping loops. Inspired by Deleuze & Guattari's Anti-Oedipus and their Schizo-analysis of politics, culture and subjectivity, his upcoming Zabte Sote release 𝘖𝘯 𝘚𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘻𝘰𝘱𝘩𝘳𝘦𝘯𝘪𝘤 𝘌𝘢𝘳𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘈𝘮𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘪𝘤 𝘓𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨 builds tape manipulations, loops, and other digital / analogue techniques in an attempt to dehistoricize and re-historicize the musical heritage that he has brought with him to Berlin.

Ihre genreübergreifende Fusion aus Disco, Shoegaze und psychedelischen Klängen haben sie zuletzt auf ihrem zweiten Album “Alive“ (2022) zu einem neuen Höhepunkt geführt. Live haben sie die Fähigkeit, auf großen Bühnen intime Konzerte zu spielen und schaffen es genauso, auch kleinere Hallen in große Säle zu verwandeln. The Flabbies erschaffen in ihrer Performance die ideale Kombination aus Licht, Bild und frei streunenden Noten und entwickeln ihren dynamischen Sound mit jedem Auftritt weiter.

The Flabbies wurden 2015 von den Jugendfreunden Oğuz Kont und Sarp Dağlar Şahin gegründet und brachten ihre EP “2015“ heraus. Mit ihrem Debütalbum “Back in Town“ erlangten sie internationale Aufmerksamkeit. Von der Pandemie ließen sie sich nicht ausbremsen, sondern arbeiteten eben online zusammen, so entstand ihre Single “Under the Sun“. Mit Can Sürmen am Schlagzeug wurden The Flabbies 2022 zu einem Trio und schlugen mit “Jungle“ im April 2022 ein neues Kapitel auf, den Schwung nutzten sie, um “Alive“ aufzunehmen. Jetzt sind sie in ganz Europa unterwegs um ihre Melodien und Tagträume unter die Menschen zu bringen.

Für diese Veranstaltung bieten wir ermäßigte Tickets an, um auch Menschen mit kleinerem Portmonee Zugang zu Kultur zu ermöglichen. Diese Kontingente sind limitiert und nur bei TixforGigs verfügbar. Wir vertrauen auf Eure Selbsteinschätzung: Wenn ihr könnt, bucht Standard-Tickets und überlasst die ermäßigten Kontingente denjenigen, die gerade sehr sparen müssen.

______________________________________________



Founded in 2015 by childhood friends Oğuz Kont and Sarp Dağlar Şahin, The Flabbies, emerged with their EP ""2015."" As Istanbul-based trailblazers of instrumental shoegaze and post-rock in Türkiye, they gained both local and international recognition with their debut album ""Back in Town,"" leading to a feature in a 2018 FIAT commercial. Renowned for their serene melodies and ethereal soundscapes, they evolved into a trio in 2022 with the drummer Can Sürmen and released their second album, ""ALIVE"", a genre-bending fusion of disco, shoegaze, and psychedelic sounds. From intimate venues to big festival stages and with a new EP on the horizon before their European Tour, The Flabbies continue to explore and innovate, inviting listeners on an exciting journey through their evolving musical landscape.

For this event we offer discounted tickets to give people with less money still access to culture. These quotas are limited and only available at TixforGigs. We trust in your self-assessment: If you can, please book standard tickets and leave the reduced tickets to those who have to save money at the moment.

1966112,Berlin,Silent Green,"Gerichtstraße 35, 13347 Berlin, Germany",https://de.ra.co/clubs/199774,Ryoji Ikeda presents ultratronics,2024-11-27,Wed 19:00,Wed 22:00,https://de.ra.co/events/1966112,Berlin Atonal,https://de.ra.co/promoters/46405,839,1st release,30.05,"Ryoji Ikeda, Pyur",18,,"The grounding of aesthetic production in the emergent formal properties of fundamental mathematical elements has been a major theme in the development of contemporary art. In this tradition Japanese artist Ryoji Ikeda stands out as the preeminent exponent. Berlin Atonal, in collaboration with silent green, is proud to host the German iteration of Ikeda’s latest major audiovisual project ultratronics [live set]. The new performance is based on the universalist principles laid out in Ikeda’s latest album ultratronics which was his first release in over a decade when it came out in 2022 and contained material designed between 1989 and 1999, along with more recent compositions developed between 2013 and 2022.

ultratronics [live set] is the culmination of Ikeda’s career long obsession with data-driven research and the ways in which the perceiving subject experiences sonic and visual phenomena, particularly when they are driven to their extremes. His audiovisual shows are operations of a particular mathematico-symbolic structure which exist as temporal artifices constructed out of the universe of pure tones, sine waves, white noise and light.

Supporting the show is German artist Pyur, aka Sophie Schnell, whose electronic compositions focus on condensed, pulsating forms that are minimal in structure and expansive in emotional texture. Her work explores the raw interplay between inner turbulence and the chaotic beauty of the external world through meticulously layered and precise sound design, pushing the boundaries of frequency and dynamic range to create immersive, multidimensional sonic environments.

Warning: this show will contain loud-noises and strobing light effects and is not recommended for people that may be sensitive to these phenomena. ",berlinatonal,N/A

Romantic post-punk and body music from Berlin. Luca Venezia on vocals and guitar, and Dame Bonnet on bass brings the  Curses ‘live’ to stage, threading the visceral connection between 1980’s inspired dark- melancholic pop to the DIY energy of early E.B.M. With 2 full length albums on Dischi Autunno, Curses has also released a limited edition LP on Paris fashion brand, Saint Laurent, and music in video campaigns for Dior, and Raf Simons/Calvin Klein. A new album is on the way, soaked in the signature Curses’ ghostly guitars and haunting vocals.

NUOVO TESTAMENTO:
Nuovo Testamento is the Los Angeles & Bologna-based trio lighting up the dance floor with their uniquely dark italo disco-flavored pop hits. Following the release of the coldwave cult favorite Exposure EP in 2019 on Avant! Records, their widely acclaimed full length New Earth exploded onto the dance floor. Including instant synthpop staple “the Searcher,” alongside Hi-NRG homage “Michelle Michelle” and goth-tinged hits like “Golden Boy,” New Earth is widely considered across genres to be one of 2021’s best underground albums of the year.

In late 2022, the composer – renowned for drifting between genres as freely as his stage name, Floating Points, implies – found himself in the Californian desert working on something new. Mere Mortals, his first ballet score, created with the San Francisco Ballet, was to be a collision of sound and dance exploring the ancient parable of Pandora through the prism of technology. “It was one of quite a few left turns I was taking around that time,” recalls Shepherd, who can say that again: Promises, his multiple end-of-year-list-topping previous record, released in 2021, had seen him swap his typical modular synth tapestries and intricate drum patterns for airy dreamscapes, crafted with late legendary saxophonist Pharoah Sanders and the London Symphony Orchestra. It was a collaboration so popular, a Mercury Prize nomination and sold-out show at the Hollywood Bowl in September 2023 followed. Between these projects and an upcoming anime score for Adult Swim, from the outside it might have seemed as though Shepherd was departing the dance floor for good. But as he wrote his ballet score by day, at night he found himself longing for the sweaty communion of the club; for the pulse-racing abandon of electronic music once more.",TrinityMusic,"https://trinitymusic.de/events/berlin/floating-points, https://www.ticketmaster.de/event/floating-points-tickets/548289"

The Expeditions series was founded in spring 2018 with a clear vision of breaking out of the monotony that defines most pure Techno nights in Berlin. The concept is to create a clear musical distinction between the different parts of the night, while remaining loyal to the classical and traditional aspects of Techno: from Detroit groove to hypnotic and atmospheric storytelling. We emphasize energy and progression. We strive to create a clear beginning and a decisive end. We believe in Techno as a journey, designed for the dance floor, rather than for podcasts. Following this principle, we curate the second floor with classic, warm, chord-led interpretations of House music, that serve as a perfect contrast to the main floor program. Occasionally, you might even find a third floor hidden in the vast garden of :// about blank. Explore, that's what the Expeditions is about.

▆  What to expect
⦿ A Power Deck with well curated interpretations of pure Techno music. No minimalism, no sophisticated preaching. 
⦿ A Comfort Deck with a contrasting program, curated with the finest House music: classic Chicago House, Soulful and New York Garage, and Berlin contemporary touches.
⦿ DJs at eye level, musically educated audience and Berlin underground at its best. 

▆ FAQ
 ⦿ Is there a dress-code? - No, the Expeditions doesn't have a dress code, but we do encourage you to be creative when choosing an outfit for the party., and to leave your everyday behind.
⦿ Is taking photos inside the club allowed?
- No. The Expeditions, and :// about blank have a strict no-photo policy. We also strongly encourage you to check in your phone at the cloakroom and lose the feeling of time. This is, however, not mandatory.⦿ Is the Expeditions a safe space for minority groups?
- The Expeditions, and :// about blank in general, are a safe space for any ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. Any sign of racism, sexism, antisemitism, or homophobia will not be tolerated. In addition, you are requested to familiarize yourself with the principles of consent, and to respect the personal space of any fellow guest.

In late 2022, the composer – renowned for drifting between genres as freely as his stage name, Floating Points, implies – found himself in the Californian desert working on something new. Mere Mortals, his first ballet score, created with the San Francisco Ballet, was to be a collision of sound and dance exploring the ancient parable of Pandora through the prism of technology. “It was one of quite a few left turns I was taking around that time,” recalls Shepherd, who can say that again: Promises, his multiple end-of-year-list-topping previous record, released in 2021, had seen him swap his typical modular synth tapestries and intricate drum patterns for airy dreamscapes, crafted with late legendary saxophonist Pharoah Sanders and the London Symphony Orchestra. It was a collaboration so popular, a Mercury Prize nomination and sold-out show at the Hollywood Bowl in September 2023 followed. Between these projects and an upcoming anime score for Adult Swim, from the outside it might have seemed as though Shepherd was departing the dance floor for good. But as he wrote his ballet score by day, at night he found himself longing for the sweaty communion of the club; for the pulse-racing abandon of electronic music once more.",TrinityMusic,"https://trinitymusic.de/events/berlin/floating-points-3, https://www.ticketmaster.de/event/floating-points-tickets/548289"

With Marcin Pietruszewski, Maxime Denuc, Arnold Dreyblatt and gamut inc.

The Berlin ensemble gamut inc (Marion Wörle and Maciej Śledziecki) presents the fourth edition of the AGGREGATE Festival at the Auenkirche and the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche Berlin on November 29 and 30. There will be new works for pipe organs by Marcin Pietruszewski (Auditory Distortion Synthesis for Organ and Computer-Generated Pluriphonic Sound) and Maxime Denuc (Nachthorn +) in the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church and by gamut inc and Arnold Dreyblatt in the Auenkirche.

Together with outstanding composers from the fields of electronic, electro-acoustic and experimental music as well as new music, gamut inc will develop pioneering artistic strategies between acoustic and electronic music on internationally renowned organs as part of the AGGREGATE series. Thousands of notes and parameters are prepared, generated and manipulated using composition programs. The pipes are controlled by the computer, but the sound comes from the pipes as in traditional playing.

Maxime Denuc is an electronic music composer based in Brussels. For some years now, his solo work has focused on church organs. He will perform Nachthorn, an entirely acoustic dance music piece with the organ as sole actor. Oscillating between dub techno and harmonic locked grooves. Nachthorn proposes a hypnotic music piece whose lines sketch the outline of an imaginary warehouse. The record was critically acclaimed, notably by Boomkat which selected it in the ten record of the year 2022. It has also been chosen as the soundtrack for the Chanel Spring-Summer 2023 Haute-Couture show.

Marcin Pietruszewski is a composer and researcher, he is engaged in sound synthesis and composition with computers, exploring specific formal developments in the tradition of electroacoustic music and contemporary sound art, as well as extra-musical domains of auditory design, computational linguistics and psychoacoustics.",guidomoebius,https://gamutinc.org/aggregate/

Fulu Miziki roughly translates to “music from garbage” which is an accurate description of the thrillingly chaotic Eco-Friendly-Afro-Futuristic-Punk-Ensemble of artists who come straight from a future where humans have reconciled with mother earth and with themselves.

This multidisciplinary collective of artists is based in the heart of Africa, in the Congolese capital city Kinshasa. For several years now, it’s members have spent their time conceptualizing an orchestra made from objects found in the trash, constantly changing instruments, and always in search of new sounds. Making their own instruments, performance costumes, and masks is essential to the approach of Fulu Miziki’s musical core ideology.

Their unique sound supports a pan-African message of artistic liberation, peace and a severe look at the ecological situation of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the whole world. For Fulu everything can be recovered and re enchanted.

Außerdem erscheint die erste richtungsweisende Singleauskopplung „Best Life“, die zusammen mit dem Berliner Duo JONAH aufgenommen wurde. 

 
Ben Böhmer sorgt auch in diesem Jahr dafür, dass alle den Atem anhalten. Nach einem kometenhaften Aufstieg ohne Gleichen besteht inzwischen kein Zweifel mehr daran, dass er sich als einer der wichtigsten zeitgenössischen Tastemaker in der elektronischen Tanzmusik etabliert hat. Unter Garantie wird das neue Album Bloom im September und die zugehörige Tournee den globalen Hype um ihn weiter entzünden und beflügeln.    

 

Tanzmusik, mit viel Groove, aber noch viel, viel mehr Gefühl. Ben Böhmer steht für tiefe, komplexe, vielstimmige Emotionen, umhüllt von Melodien und Rhythmen, die Massen weltweit gleichermaßen zu Tränen rühren und in ungehemmte Euphorie verfallen lassen.  

Sein Debütalbum „Breathing“ und der Nachfolger „Begin Again“ haben neue Standards gesetzt. Dazu war die eigene Welttournee restlos ausverkauft. Dementsprechend hoch sind die Erwartungen an den Nachfolger „Bloom“, der auf dem legendären Label Ninja Tune erscheinen wird, das schon Giganten wie Bonobo oder Bicep großgezogen hat.   

Die Geschwindigkeit und der Impact, mit dem Ben Böhmer die größten Bühnen dieser Welt gestürmt hat, lässt wenig Vergleiche. Doch der Künstler hat trotz all des Ruhms und Erfolgs nicht vergessen, wer er ist und von wo er kommt. Das neue Album „Bloom“ verkörpert sowohl Rückbesinnung als auch Aufbruch. Die neuen Tracks spiegeln die anfängliche Liebe für Experimentelles und Improvisation und dennoch eröffnen sie ein gänzliches Neues Kapitel in der Karriere des jungen Künstlers: Wir erhalten Einblick in eine innere Welt, die reifen und sich festigen konnte. Aus dem resultiert eine künstlerische Vision, die an Weitläufigkeit, Facettenreichtum und Entschlossenheit alles Bisherige in den Schatten stellt.   

 

Ein weiteres Zeugnis für das Genie des Ausnahmekünstlers ist die Zusammenarbeit mit einer ganzen Riege an namhaften Gästen auf der neuen Veröffentlichung, darunter Lykke Li oder Enfant Sauvage von The Blaze. Nach Shows als Headliner auf dem SONAR oder dem Lollapalooza wird im November die neue Tour starten. Diese besteht aus acht europäischen Shows, darunter drei Konzerten in Deutschland und eine Show im legendären Alexandra Palace in London.

There will be new works for pipe organs by Marcin Pietruszewski (Auditory Distortion Synthesis for Organ and Computer-Generated Pluriphonic Sound) and Maxime Denuc (Nachthorn +) in the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church and by gamut inc and Arnold Dreyblatt in the Auenkirche.

Together with outstanding composers from the fields of electronic, electro-acoustic and experimental music as well as new music, gamut inc will develop pioneering artistic strategies between acoustic and electronic music on internationally renowned organs as part of the AGGREGATE series. Thousands of notes and parameters are prepared, generated and manipulated using composition programs. The pipes are controlled by the computer, but the sound comes from the pipes as in traditional playing.

Arnold Dreyblatt (b. New York City, 1953) is an American media artist and composer. He has been based in Berlin since 1984. Dreyblatt is the Vice-Director of the Visual Arts Section of the Akademie der Künste in Berlin. One of the second generation of New York minimal composers, Dreyblatt studied music with Pauline Oliveros, La Monte Young, and Alvin Lucier and media art with Woody and Steina Vasulka. He has invented a set of new and original instruments, performance techniques, and a system of tuning.

Zusammen bilden die Hamburger einen Katalysator für Einflüsse von Frank Zappa und Weather Report bis zu J Dilla und Terrace Martin. Gleichzeitig atmen sie die Wolken einer jungen globalen Jazzszene. Beschleunigt durch die unbändige Energie ihrer Liveshows kreieren die vier auch im Studio ihren ganz eigenen Vibe.

Bass Hitze, Percussion-Sound-Megapalette, Schlagzeug-Frechheit, Hypnose-Gitarre. Ganz nach dem Vorbild amerikanischer Musik-Kollektive wie Soulquarians oder The Roots sehen sich TOYTOY als kreativer Impulsgeber und Möglichmacher für die Fusion aus Jazz und Urban Music wie Soul und Rap.

TOYTOY haben sich in den letzten Jahren in der deutschen Jazz- und Groove-Szene einen Namen gemacht mit ihrer Konzertreihe „re-jazzed“, in der sie ikonische Hip-Hop-Alben dekonstruieren und zu den Wurzeln der ursprünglich gesampelten Jazz-Klassiker zurückführen. Es folgten diverse eigene Veröffentlichungen, u.a. mit der NDR Bigband und Giovanni Weiss.

Gemeinsam mit Produzent und Dub-Wizzard Umberto Echo, der die Gruppe seit ihren Anfängen als ambitionierte Teenagerband in den späten Nullerjahren kennt, wagen TOYTOY nun auf ihrem neuesten Album „Surprise Surprise“ den Sprung in bisher ungewohntes Terrain. Mit illustren Gästen aus Umberto Echos Oneness Records Kosmos wie Gentleman Keyboarder Frank Pollak und Dub Inc. Bassist Moritz von Korff verschmelzen die hyperkreativen Hamburger ihren eklektischen Stil mit karibisch-britischen Reggaegrooves und Dub-Klängen.

Die Releasetour zum Album im Herbst 2024 wird von Umberto Echo live abgemischt und verspricht ein Fest für Audiophile wie Tanzwütige gleichermaßen zu werden. Als Gäste am Keyboard werden abwechselnd Friedrich Paravicini und Yannis Anft mit dabei sein.

Umberto Echo: Nach Remixen für Abdullah Ibrahim Anfang der Nullerjahre geht es für den Münchner Sound Professor dubbend um den Globus. Es entstehen zwei weltmusikalische Dub-Jazz Alben für das renommierte Label Enja Records mit Jojo Mayer, Josh Roseman, Peter Apfelbaum, Barney McAll, Jean-Louis Matinier, Justin Brown, Ambrose Akinmusire und vielen weiteren Mitstreitern. 2010 erscheint „Dub The World“ auf dem Echo Beach Label mit UE-Remixen von Sly&Robbie, Gentleman, Seeed, Steel Pulse feat. Damien Marley, Stereo MCs etc. Zwischen den eigenen Projekten schraubte Umberto an über 300 Alben für Künstler wie Quadro Nuevo, Jazzrausch Bigband, Silvan Strauss, Lisa Wulff, Dub Inc, Sara Lugo, Dub Spencer & Trance Hill und Produktionen für sein eigenes Reggae Label Oneness Records mit Sängern wie Alborosie, Junior Kelly, Sizzla, Capleton, Luciano. Um ab und zu an die frische Luft zu kommen hat Mr. Echo seit 1999 über 1500 Livekonzerte gemischt.

Für diese Veranstaltung bieten wir ermäßigte Tickets an, um auch Menschen mit kleinerem Portmonee Zugang zu Kultur zu ermöglichen. Diese Kontingente sind limitiert und nur bei TixforGigs verfügbar. Wir vertrauen auf Eure Selbsteinschätzung: Wenn ihr könnt, bucht Standard-Tickets und überlasst die ermäßigten Kontingente denjenigen, die gerade sehr sparen müssen.

Cologne-based electronic pop duo COMA, aka Marius Bubat and Georg Conrad, are back with a new single and tour dates for next year.

The world is getting colder, but COMA are bringing some warmth into our lives. COMA's melodic innovations between indie and electronica have always been incredibly accessible, unafraid of neither hooks nor emotions, and expanding the scope of what club music can be from album to album. “The Same” is therefore the next logical step - away from the dancefloor, closer to life. 

COMA fuse dance music with an indie sensibility rich in melody and melancholy. They may have their roots firmly planted in Cologne's legendary club scene, but their effervescent, groovy synth-pop blurs the boundaries and pushes far beyond. After a series of releases on Kompakt Records, Marius Bubat and Georg Conrad released their latest album ""Voyage Voyage"" on City Slang in 2019. The album featured songs with verse, bridge and chorus - a first for COMA, and yet: it pulsated and immediately captivated the listener. The new song structures are also firmly rooted in club culture. After the album and the successful single ""A Train"", further singles followed, including the hit ""Start/Stop/Rewind"" (2022) and ""Beyond You and Me"" with Dillon (2022).

Tracks such as ""Moscow Idaho,"" ""One Millionth Happy Customer,"" and ""The War Against Sleep"" catapulted them to fame across Europe. Extensive tours solidified their position as one of the foremost post-punk bands of their time.

Der musikalische Hintergrund des Autodidakten ist stark von Southern Soul, Blues und Funk beeinflusst. Sein Bassspiel findet sich in Aufnahmen von Mac Miller und Jacob Collier, seine Mitwirkung am 2020er Nas-Studioalbum ""King's Disease"" brachte ihm einen Grammy ein, er spielte mit Ghost-Note –dem Funk-Jazz-Spin off von Snarky Puppy- und war einer der letzten Bassisten von Funk-Großmeister Prince. Flea von den Red Hot Chili Peppers bezeichnete ihn als ""the greatest fucking electric bass player"". MonoNeon veröffentlicht ständig eigene Musik, einen Song nach dem anderen, ein Album nach dem anderen, und alles was er macht, ist großartig.

Orientiert an der ästhetischen Moderne des 20. Jahrhunderts, beeinflusst von der klassischen Avantgarde eines John Cage und den Readymades von Marcel Duchamp, ist nicht nur seine Musik avantgardistisch. MonoNeon erschafft sich selbst als Kunstwerk. Mit extravaganter Kleidung, gehäkelten Masken, schrillen Brillen und mit einem ebenfalls kostümierten Instrument erscheint er beinahe als Pop-Art Comicfigur. Bei Fender gibt’s inzwischen sogar eine exklusive MonoNeon Kollektion, dazu gehört auch der MonoNeon Jazz Bass V Signature.

Manche Künstler’innen erstarren hinter ihren Alter Egos, Masken und Inszenierungen, andere befreien sich. MonoNeon, das lässt sich mit Sicherheit sagen, hat sich für die Freiheit entschieden und besitzt einen ausgezeichneten Humor, der sich auch musikalisch ausdrückt. Wer MonoNeon noch nicht kennt, sollte sich seinen YouTube Kanal ansehen. Hier ist jedes Video ein Manifest, alles wird Funk.

⫸⫸ ABOUT FOUR PLAY ⫸⫸
Imagine a party in which you're not just moving your feet on the dance floor. Imagine a place full of color and fantasy, in which you are welcomed to take part in the action.
In 2016, the Four Play project was born in order to breach the all-too-serious walls of those days' Berlin kinky and fetish scenes, and to allow the young and the inexperienced to experiment with many aspects of the kinky lifestyle and their own sexuality.
In the mean, Four Play has become one of Berlin’s most beautiful sex-positive and kinky parties, offering not just an uncompromising musical lineup, but also an incredibly rich program of performances and workshops, all designed for our guests to interact and become an active part of the night.

⫸⫸ WHAT TO EXPECT ⫸⫸
▻ High-end Techno journey on the Main Floor, happy modern interpretations of House music in the Dragon Floor, and Downtempo to Soft-Tech in the basement.
▻ Around 80 Performances, walking acts and Workshops.
▻ A Kinky Marketplace to upgrade your outfits.
▻ Hedonistic safe space for kinksters and LGTBQ.
▻ A large, highly dedicated Awareness Team.

⫸⫸ MUST READ ⫸⫸
▻ NO PRESALE. Tickets only at the door.
▻ The Four Play has a strict no-photo and no phone policy. We have a designated photobooth with our photographer, where photos can be taken of those who wish for it.
▻ The Four Play is a safe space for any ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. Any sign of racism, sexism, or homophobia will not be tolerated.
▻ You are to respect the personal space of any fellow dancer. In case you feel that you have been treated wrongly, or that your space has been violated, please notify our awareness team or our staff immediately.
▻ DRESS-CODE: * Sexy Swimsuits * Costumes * Leather * Latex * Naked * Super Heroes * Lingerie * Colorful Festival Style.
NO CASUAL STREET WEAR SUCH AS JEANS IS ALLOWED.

FAQ
1. Can single or groups of hetero men join the party?
- In general, women, and queers are rarely a threat to a sexpositive concept. Men are more carefully selected, and would have to be able to prove acquaintance with the guidelines of consent.
2. Are normal bathing or boxer shorts enough?
- No, they aren’t. With swimwear we mean sexy swimwear (yes men, better show us your Speedos).
3. Is the usual Kitkat or Four Play dress code enough?
- Yes, they are, however, we kindly ask you to make an effort and adapt to the Four Play colourful character.
4. Am I allowed to masturbate in front of people or playful couples?
- No, you’re not. Solo-Wankers are not welcomed at the Four Play and without explicit consent, are considered an harassment.
5. What do I do if I or someone around me feel uncomfortable or mistreated?
- Please report that to our Awareness Team immediately. You can either find them patrolling the club in shiny vests, or at the Awareness Station at the Pool Bar.

Stellt euch eine Party vor, bei der ihr nicht nur eure Füße auf der Tanzfläche bewegt. Stellt euch einen Ort voller Farbe und Fantasie vor, an dem ihr eingeladen seid, am Programm teilzunehmen.
Im Jahr 2016 wurde das Projekt Four Play ins Leben gerufen, um die allzu ernsten Mauern der damaligen Berliner Kinky- und Fetischszene zu durchbrechen und jungen und unerfahrenen Menschen die Möglichkeit zu geben, mit vielen Aspekten des kinky Lebensstils und ihrer eigenen Sexualität zu experimentieren.
Inzwischen ist Four Play eine der schönsten sex-positiven und kinky Partys in Berlin und bietet nicht nur ein kompromissloses musikalisches Lineup, sondern auch ein unglaublich reichhaltiges Programm an Performances und Workshops, bei denen unsere Gäste interagieren und ein aktiver Teil der Nacht werden können.

⫸⫸ WAS KANN MAN ERWARTEN ⫸⫸
▻ High-End Techno-Reise auf dem Main Floor, fröhliche moderne Interpretationen von House-Musik im Dragon Floor und Downtempo bis Soft-Tech im Keller.

FAQ
1. Können einzelne oder Gruppen von Hetero-Männern an der Party teilnehmen?
- Im Allgemeinen sind Frauen und Queers selten eine Bedrohung für ein sexpositives Konzept. Männer werden strenger ausgewählt und müssen nachweisen können, dass sie mit den Leitlinien des Konsens vertraut sind.
2. Sind normale Bade- oder Boxershorts genug?
- Nein, das sind sie nicht. Mit Bademode meinen wir sexy Bademode (ja, Männer, zeigt uns lieber eure Speedos).
3. Ist der übliche Kitkat oder Four Play Dresscode ausreichend?
- Ja, aber wir bitten dich, dich zu bemühen und dich an den farbenfrohen Charakter von Four Play anzupassen.
4. Darf ich vor Leuten oder spielenden Paaren masturbieren?
- Nein, das darfst du nicht. Solo-Wichser sind im Four Play nicht willkommen und werden ohne eindeutige Zustimmung als Belästigung angesehen.
5. Was tue ich, wenn ich oder jemand in meiner Umgebung sich unwohl fühlt oder misshandelt wird?
- Bitte melde das sofort unserem Awareness-Team. Du findest sie entweder in leuchtenden Westen im Club oder an der Awareness Station an der Pool Bar.",Section8,N/A

Alessandro Cortini is an Italian musician, producer, composer, and instrument builder. Cortini is one of the foremost figures of contemporary electronic music, best known for his haunting, atmospheric work. Alongside being a longstanding member of Nine Inch Nails, he is highly prolific and has released a steady stream of his own heady music on luminary labels including Mute, Hospital, and Important Records for the past decade. Throughout his shadowy rise to fame, he has collaborated with the likes of Lawrence English, Daniel Avery and Merzbow (to name a few). Balancing dark ambience with smokey, pulsing rhythms, his compositions are perfectly restrained, textured and mesmeric. Cortini was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020 through his work with Nine Inch Nails, making history as the only Italian musician to have ever been honored with this recognition. 

Agnese Menguzzato is a Berlin-based composer and musician. Based on her training in violin and Renaissance lute, she has forged her own musical path by playing at the interface between past and present sounds, often utilizing the tonal potential of the lute.",silent-green,"https://www.silent-green.net/en/programme/detail/2024/12/6/alessandro-cortini, https://www.eventbrite.de/e/alessandro-cortini-tickets-967595553347?fbclid=IwY2xjawEi6C9leHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHZ8PeWaQ91mjb7Jy8z_2ihFEAFH-atPBMSURgqgUVz_nInR6q8C89cHi0w_aem_a3_IwEkWITJFnLk9jJruLg"

And there they are again: the elegance, the style, the French chic or even the grandeur that characterize L'Impératrice. 

There are even rumors that the band members have a disco ball spinning in the glow of the spotlights where their hearts usually beat, but these are just rumors. The fact is: After the strong album ""Tako Tsubo"" from 2021, ""Me Da Igual"" manages a nice balancing act between the sound DNA of L'Impératrice and new ideas. The track is light and driving at the same time, a single relaxed dance between this unique groove, vintage synths and these strangely floating melodies. The band themselves say they want to make the intensity of the clubs and sleepless nights palpable, to feel the strobes and disco balls, to create night images that are forever imprinted on the body and mind. 
 
This year, L'Impératrice will finally release a new album, which will also include ""Me Da Igual"". They will present it to their fans at an exclusive, sold-out residency in Berlin in March - performances in which art and music will merge with each other as a matter of course. They will then return at the end of the year to continue their tour in other cities.

Early improvised soundtracks to spontaneous storytelling have transformed into future folk songs. Their work includes collaborations with many other musicians and artists, live and in the studio, connecting pathways of knowledge through sound. Their primary form of artistic practice is a form of musical conversation which they have evolved together and with others over the past two years. Their music is contemporary in the real sense in that it connects to many different styles and forms of music. Both Hilary Jeffery and Eleni Poulou have an immense experience of playing music in many contexts from new music to rock, improvised music to art installations. This broad palette provides a deep creative source which they crystallise into their own distinct and recognisable music.

Born out of a long-standing collaboration between four improvising musicians, Brique plays with construction and deconstruction like a post-punk Russian doll, toying with the codes of song format. Shamelessly fusing multiple influences, from rap to romanticism, classical harmonies and lyrical flights to hammered lyrics, the accident is never far away, often throwing the writing into disarray.
The cut-up, the practice of collage in writing, gives the vocals a punchy character while the instruments are ready to pounce at any moment. While each track has its own colour, the whole repertoire is united by the slightly overflowing energy and exaggerated expressionism of the performers.

The Expeditions series was founded in spring 2018 with a clear vision of breaking out of the monotony that defines most pure Techno nights in Berlin. The concept is to create a clear musical distinction between the different parts of the night, while remaining loyal to the classical and traditional aspects of Techno: from Detroit groove to hypnotic and atmospheric storytelling. We emphasize energy and progression. We strive to create a clear beginning and a decisive end. We believe in Techno as a journey, designed for the dance floor, rather than for podcasts. Following this principle, we curate the second floor with classic, warm, chord-led interpretations of House music, that serve as a perfect contrast to the main floor program. Occasionally, you might even find a third floor hidden in the vast garden of :// about blank. Explore, that's what the Expeditions is about.

▆  What to expect
⦿ A Power Deck with well curated interpretations of pure Techno music. No minimalism, no sophisticated preaching. 
⦿ A Comfort Deck with a contrasting program, curated with the finest House music: classic Chicago House, Soulful and New York Garage, and Berlin contemporary touches.
⦿ DJs at eye level, musically educated audience and Berlin underground at its best. 

▆ FAQ
 ⦿ Is there a dress-code? - No, the Expeditions doesn't have a dress code, but we do encourage you to be creative when choosing an outfit for the party., and to leave your everyday behind.
⦿ Is taking photos inside the club allowed?
- No. The Expeditions, and :// about blank have a strict no-photo policy. We also strongly encourage you to check in your phone at the cloakroom and lose the feeling of time. This is, however, not mandatory.⦿ Is the Expeditions a safe space for minority groups?
- The Expeditions, and :// about blank in general, are a safe space for any ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. Any sign of racism, sexism, antisemitism, or homophobia will not be tolerated. In addition, you are requested to familiarize yourself with the principles of consent, and to respect the personal space of any fellow guest.

Jazz, Hip-Hop und Beatmaking fließen bei ihm wie selbstverständlich ineinander und verschmelzen zu einem unverwechselbaren Stil. Wer seine Videos gesehen hat, in denen er schwingende Mikrofone und kippende Milchkännchen in seine improvisierten Drumsets integriert, weiß, mit welcher Begeisterung er bei der Sache ist.

In Kempten geboren wuchs er mit deutschen Radio-Bigbands, Punkrock und Hip-Hop-Alben aus der goldenen Ära auf, spielte schon als Kind auf allem Schlagzeug, was er in die Finger bekam und wirkte im Bayerischen Landesjugendjazzorchester mit. Zwischen den Proben produzierte er eigene Beats, wechselte zwischen Punk- und Hip-Hop-Bands, und studierte schließlich an der Hamburger Musikhochschule. Sein Eintauchen in Hamburgs Livemusikszene brachte ihm 2021 den Hamburger Jazzpreis ein.

In den letzten Jahren arbeitete er mit Größen wie Maria João, Soweto Kinch, Omer Klein, Guinga, Farhot, Jazzrausch Bigband und Till Brönner zusammen. Den immensen Input aus all den verschiedenen Kollaborationen lässt Strauss in das Projekt Toytoy einfließen, wo er produziert und eng mit seinen Bandkollegen an einer Vision von experimenteller Groove-Musik arbeitet.

Strauss veröffentlicht seine eigene Musik bei Kabul Fire Records, wo er die organische und analoge Seite des Beatmakings repräsentiert. Ende 2024 wird er sein zweites Studioalbum FLUKIN‘ mit beeindruckenden Gastauftritten wie Oscar#Worldpeace, Salomea, Joe Armon-Jones, Farhot oder Mehdi Qamoum veröffentlichen.

 

Reuben James, Singer-Songwriter und Pianist aus Birmingham, bewegt sich zwischen Soul, Funk, Jazz, R’n’B, Hip-Hop und mehr. Der oft überstrapazierte Begriff “Eklektisch“ trifft in seinem Fall durchaus zu, so frei fließt seine Musik zwischen den Genres, so anspielungsreich und gehaltvoll sind seine Improvisationen, so gekonnt lotet er die Grenzen zwischen Jazz und Popaffinität aus. Nicht zuletzt deshalb, aber auch wegen seiner virtuosen Jazztechniken und seiner einfühlsamen Stimme gehört er zu den spannendsten und kreativsten Künstler*innen der letzten Jahre.

Bevor er 2019 mit seiner ersten EP “Adore“ und seinem Debütalbum “Champagne Kisses“ (2023) solo für Furore sorgte, hat er sich seine bunte Klangpalette in jahrelangen Kollaborationen erarbeitet. Im Elternhaus von Blues, Jazz und Gospel inspiriert, spielte er bereits mit 17 Jahren im Quartett des Trompeters Abram Wilson. Sein Stipendium am renommierten Trinity College of Music in London brach er gegen den Rat seiner Eltern vorzeitig ab, um stattdessen lieber mit Sam Smith auf Tour zu gehen, der seiner Meinung nach damals vor dem Durchbruch stand. Reines Bauchgefühl und er lag goldrichtig damit. Er begleitete Sam Smith nicht nur auf seinen Tourneen, sondern schrieb auch an dessen Erfolgsalbum “The Thrill Of It All“ (2017) mit und arbeitete mit Musiker*innen aus den unterschiedlichsten musikalischen Welten zusammen, darunter Joni Mitchell, Stormzy, Bonnie Raitt, Herbie Hancock, Elton John und Disclosure.

Aufgewachsen mit einer Liebe für Jazz, Soul, Kraut und Soundtracks der 60er und 70er Jahre, drückt seine Musik eine warme Palette von Farben, analogen instrumentalen Grooves und euphorischer Sentimentalität aus. Ende letzten Jahres präsentierte er seine Debüt-EP „The Changing Tides Of Dreams“.

Inspiriert von Soundtrack-Komponisten der 1950er bis 1970er Jahre wie Piero Umiliani und David Axelrod, bezieht sich „The Changing Tides Of Dreams“ auf die Art und Weise, wie sich unser Leben und unser Selbst ständig verändern, lernen und wachsen, ohne jemals vollständig geformt oder zufrieden zu sein. Das Projekt, das während einer Zeit der persönlichen Transformation von Sholto geschrieben wurde, verbindet unverfälschte ätherische Texturen mit einem tiefen Gefühl von Nostalgie und Sehnsucht, indem es auf Disziplinen aus der Welt des Films und der klassischen Musik sowie auf Jazz und experimentelle Arrangementtechniken zurückgreift. 

Seine Musikkarriere begann 2013, als ihn ein Plattenvertrag nach LA führte und er mit Produzenten wie Nick Waterhouse (Allah-Las) zusammenarbeitete, bevor er nach Großbritannien zurückkehrte und mit Leuten wie Inflo (Cleo Sol) und Dan Carey (Wet Leg, Squid) zusammenarbeitete. Er ist auch die eine Hälfte des Produktionsduos Sunglasses For Jaws. Sholto wird außerdem von Größen wie Gilles Peterson, Deb Grant, Jyoty und Tony Minvielle unterstützt.

MALIKA ALAOUI (NORLYZ Music/D) *live*,18,"Jazz, Electronica","NORLYZ: Handmade Electronic Dance-Jazz

Die elektroakustische Live-Band verbindet die Wärme und Fragilität akustischer Instrumente mit der Präzision und Energie elektronischer Musik: tanzbar und nuanciert zugleich, inspiriert von Techno, Weltmusik und Jazz. Die facettenreichen Arrangements lassen Raum für Improvisation und nehmen das Publikum mit auf eine Reise durch Parallelwelten, mystische Orte und cineastische Klangdimensionen.

Im Jahr 2022 veröffentlichten sie ihr Debütalbum “First Dawn On Planet B.”. Auf ihrem eigenen Label NORLYZ Music sowie auf 3000Grad Records und Best Works sind eine Reihe von Singles, Trailern und Live-Videos erschienen, darunter Remixe von André Lodemann, JPattersson und Mollono.Bass. Seit ihrer Gründung spielte die Band u.a. auf der Fusion und Festivals wie Detect Classic, Elbjazz und 3000Grad sowie zahlreiche Clubshows.

Paul David Heckhausen ist als Gründer, Produzent, Komponist und Live-Musiker die treibende Kraft hinter NORLYZ. Der Schlagzeuger und Pianist kommt aus der Rock- und Jazzmusik und studierte Komposition und Musikproduktion in den Niederlanden. Um elektronische und akustische Musik zu verbinden, gründete er das Projekt “Schattenspiel”, aus dem NORLYZ mit neuer Besetzung und neuem Sound hervorging.

Der ungarische Cellist Gábor Hartyáni war bereits 2019 bei Schattenspiel involviert und hat eine Vorliebe für Groove, Weltmusik und Jazz.

Der Trompeter Philipp Püschel und der Saxophonist Lasse Golz haben sich während ihres Jazzstudiums in Hamburg kennengelernt. Sie spielen unter anderem in der Space-Jazz-Band ROCKET MEN und regelmäßig mit der Techno-Marching-Band MEUTE.

NORLYZ: Handmade Electronic Dance-Jazz

The electro-acoustic live band unites the warmth and fragility of acoustic instruments with the precision and power of the electronics: captivating grooves rich in fine sonic details, inspired by techno, world music and jazz. Guiding the audience NORLYZ embarks on a journey through parallel worlds, mystical lands and cinematic soundscapes. While following an intricate dramaturgy, the project leaves space for creative improvisation between the 4 musicians aiming to elevate each other and the overall experience.

Since their start as NORLYZ in June 2022, the band has played several shows, including Fusion, Detect Classic, Elbjazz and 3000Grad Festival, as well as club shows at Sisyphos Berlin and Knust Hamburg, among others. On November 18, 2022, the band released their debut album ""First Dawn On Planet B."", which is also available as a limited double vinyl since June 2, 2023. In addition, a number of singles, trailers and live videos were released: via their own label NORLYZ Music, 3000Grad Records and Best Works Records including remixes by André Lodemann, JPattersson and Mollono.Bass.

Just as multifaceted as the music are the backgrounds of the 4 musicians: Paul David Heckhausen as founder, producer, composer and live musician is the driving force of NORLYZ. As a drummer and pianist he comes from rock and jazz music, traveled and drummed for a year in Brazil and finally studied composition and music production in the Netherlands. After a phase as a DJ, he followed up on his urge to play more live again and to combine electronic with acoustic music. So he founded Schattenspiel, the predecessor project which is known today in a new line-up as NORLYZ.

Cellist Gábor Hartyáni comes from Hungary, lived and studied in the Netherlands, and has a penchant for groove, world music and jazz. He has been playing with Schattenspiel since 2019.

Trumpeter Philipp Püschel and saxophonist Lasse Golz met while studying jazz in Hamburg. The two play together with Paul in the space jazz band ROCKET MEN, among others, as well as regularly with the techno marching band MEUTE. Philipp and Paul know each other from their time together in a big band in Hannover.

Er ist zweifacher UK Beatbox Champion, MC, bühnenpräsenter Comedian, begnadeter Improvisator, Produzent und Pionier des Live-Loopings. Wer ihn einmal live gesehen hat, wird dieses Spektakel nie vergessen.

Bekannt wurde der Brite Darren Foreman vor allem durch seine einzigartigen Live-Sets. Dort lotet er die Grenzen des Human Beatboxing aus, indem er alle Sounds live erzeugt, sie gleichzeitig durch Loop- und Effektgeräte jagt und daraus komplette Songs entstehen lässt. Sein Werkzeug: Mund, Nase, Rachen - Geräuschimitationen und Stimmeffekte in perfekter Abstimmung. Um Spontaneität und Kreativität nicht an der Technik scheitern zu lassen, hat er mit Beardytron das weltweit wohl umfangreichste und freieste Live-Produktionssystem aller Zeiten entwickelt, um seine Echtzeit-Workflows und Live-Improvisationen auf der Bühne in Studioqualität produzieren zu können.

Berühmtheit erlangte er auch als beatboxende Super-Hausfrau in „Kitchen Diaries” auf YouTube. Der Clip ist etwas älter, aber immer wieder für ein Revival gut. Sensationell war seine Show “One Album per Hour“, bei der er live auf der Bühne aus vom Publikum erfundenen Songtiteln ein brandneues Album kreierte. Sein Debütalbum nannte er kurzerhand selbstironisch „I Done A Album”. Darauf versammelt: Ein unfassbares Spektrum disparater Tracks aus schrägen Electronica-Experimenten, die sich von Dubstep über Funk und Drum’n’Bass bis hin zu psychedelischem Dub in alle Gefilde vorwagten.

Was Beardyman auf der Bühne macht, ist für Uneingeweihte nur schwer zu erklären - man muss es erleben. Er ist mehr als ein Musiker oder MC, er ist ein Wanderer zwischen den Welten des Hip-Hop, der Aktionskunst und der Comedy. Seine bisherigen Auftritte im Gretchen sind unvergesslich. Wir sind gespannt auf die neuen Überraschungen des Beatbox-Meisters.

Für diese Veranstaltung bieten wir ermäßigte Tickets an, um auch Menschen mit kleinerem Portmonee Zugang zu Kultur zu ermöglichen. Diese Kontingente sind limitiert und nur bei TixforGigs verfügbar. Wir vertrauen auf Eure Selbsteinschätzung: Wenn ihr könnt, bucht Standard-Tickets und überlasst die ermäßigten Kontingente denjenigen, die gerade sehr sparen müssen.

_____________________________________


Of all the beatboxing personalities, there is still only one who sets the tone, and that is Beardyman. He is a two-time UK beatboxing champion, an MC, a stage-present comedian, a producer and a gifted live improviser.

The Briton Darren Foreman is particularly known for his unique live sets at festivals such as Glastonbury, Sonar, Reading and Roskilde. He explores the boundaries of human beatboxing - mostly improvised - by creating all sounds live and simultaneously chasing them through four Korg Kaoss Pads loop and effect devices to create complete songs. His tools: mouth, nose, throat - sound imitations and voice effects in perfect harmony.

He gained fame especially as a beatboxing super housewife in ""Kitchen Diaries"" on the internet. He unceremoniously titled his debut album with the self-deprecating ""I Done A Album"". Gathered on it: An unfathomable spectrum of disparate tracks from weird electronic experiments, Balkan dubstep and world music flair to township funk, drum'n'bass, psychedelic dub and IDM.

His past performances at Gretchen are unforgettable, especially because Beardyman places a high value on improvisation. We look forward to the latest surprises from the beatbox master.

USA Nails (UK / One Little Independent)

London noise rock quartet USA Nails released their new album ‘Feel Worse’ on March 22nd 2024. The band have forged a considerable reputation since their formation in 2013 from their South London base, comprising of members of Kong, Future Of The Left, Blacklisters, Death Pedals and Silent Front. 

‘Feel Worse’ explores schadenfreude — the pleasure derived from another person's misfortune. With this, they use new material to attack austerity and UK authoritarianism, consumer culture (particularly the consumption of quick fix reality TV and hyper-capitalist agendas), youth culture and bullying, and more. They do so with their intense and unmistakable brand of abrasive, chaotic post-hardcore. There’s a raw and uncompromising energy to USA Nails, and ‘Feel Worse’ is their most powerful and vital album to date. 

The band have toured with Sub Pop’s Metz and UK noise rock legends Mclusky. They have completed numerous US and European headline stints, as well as supporting the likes of Future Of The Left, Mission Of Burma, No Age, Cocaine Piss, Viagra Boys, Hey Colossus and Unsane.

“A truly bracing racket” – The Wire

“Sonic titans” – The Quietus

“Punishing brute force” – Loud And Quiet


TV Cult (UK/DE)

TV Cult are an eighties inspired Post-Punk band from Cologne. With brooding and dominant bass lines, cold and frantic guitars, powerful drums, and vocals iterating between crooning goth and DC hardcore, TV Cult create a sound that is both reminiscent of bands like Joy Division, Black Flag and Idles; yet is truly unique.

Nubya Garcia lässt sich nicht so leicht in eine Schublade stecken. Ist es Jazz? Sicher, die in London geborene Saxophonistin, Komponistin und Bandleaderin wuchs in diesem Genre auf und studierte bei der berühmten Jazzpianistin Nikki Yeoh. Doch wer ihre beiden Alben “Source“ (2020) und jetzt “Odyssey“ hört, entdeckt eine genreübergreifende Kreativität, die sich aus dem Wunsch speist, alles in allen Disziplinen zu machen und sich über sämtliche Schubladen hinwegzusetzen.

Ihr gerade erschienenes Album “Odyssey“ mischt orchestrale Arrangements mit R&B, Jazz, Broken Beat und Dub. Eine großartige Platte, sehr persönlich und nuanciert, luftig und himmlisch, ohne den Groove zu vergessen.

Damit knüpft sie nahtlos an den Vorgänger an. “Source“ erschien beim renommierten Label Concord Jazz, wurde prompt für den renommierten Mercury Prize nominiert, von Pitchfork als „Best New Music“ und vom Rolling Stone als „Album des Monats“ ausgezeichnet und machte sie schlagartig international bekannt. Die New York Times beschrieb das Album als „ein mitreißendes Set aus Jazz mit afro-karibischen Einflüssen, das die Erfahrungen eines ganzen Lebens in einer Stunde Hörgenuss bündelt“.

Nubya Garcia gehört zu den Gründungsmitgliedern der Londoner Jazz-Szene, die das Genre modernisiert und einer jüngeren Generation zugänglich gemacht hat, indem sie die Jazztradition mit tanzbaren und clubtauglichen musikalischen Einflüssen der britischen Jugendkultur verbindet.

______________________________


Nubya Garcia is coming to Berlin with her brand new album ""Odyssey"".

Nubya Garcia isn’t an artist you can easily classify. Is it jazz? Sure, the London-born saxophonist, composer and bandleader grew up studying the genre under the noted pianist Nikki Yeoh at Camden Music. But it isn’t until you listen to albums like 2020’s Source and 2024’s Odyssey that you hear broader creativity shining through: It’s jazz, classical, dub, R&B and whatever else Garcia wants to convey. It all comes from a place of exploration and self-study, of wanting to do all the things across all disciplines while ignoring arbitrary boxes that don’t fit. Garcia’s sophomore album Odyssey, out in September 2024 via Concord Jazz, is a majestic feat on which she blends orchestral arrangements with R&B, jazz, broken beat and dub, resulting in a grand, nuanced record that feels airy and celestial without sacrificing the groove. It’s a deeply personal offering about her trek to falling back in love with musical composition over the past four years.

Source, her 2020 debut album, was released via Concord Jazz to massive critical acclaim, an NPR Tiny Desk (Home) Concert, a Pitchfork “Best New Music” review and a Rolling Stone “Album of the Month” mention. In a profile, The New York Times called Source “a sweeping set of jazz with Afro-Caribbean influences that funnels a life’s worth of experiences into an hourlong listen.” Also upon release, the album entered the UK charts in the Top 30, and she was just one of three artists selected to perform live at Glastonbury’s 2020 Experience, which aired on the BBC to thousands of viewers. Source was also nominated for the Mercury Prize, a prestigious award given to the best albums from the UK or Ireland.

In 2022, Garcia toured the US in support of Khruangbin, performing in sold-out venues including Radio City Music Hall in New York, the Ryman in Nashville and the Met in Philadelphia. She then headlined her own tour in the UK and US, performing at various festivals including Glastonbury, Love Supreme, Pickathon and Newport Jazz.

Trip! Kick! Sich eine Dröhnung Botticelli Baby live zu geben, heißt schweißnasses Haar, Muskelkater am nächsten Tag und Dauergrinsen in der Fresse! Wie bereitet man sich darauf vor? Gar nicht! Man kommt wie man ist und lässt die Sau raus!

Um dem wilden Sound das zu geben, was man als eine Mischung aus Jazz, Punk, Blues, Folk und Pop beschreiben muss, benötigt es genau sieben verschiedene ingredients. Und zwar in Gestalt von Musikern und in Form ihrer Instrumente!

Es ist ein Rausch, ein einziges Fest, wenn die Band auftritt. Die sieben Typen wirken wie fest zusammengefügtes Material, unverwüstlich und doch extrem chaotisch. Jedes Instrument bringt seine individuelle Stärke mit und schiebt den gesamten Karren damit auf Mission Ekstase auf irgendeinen fremden Planeten! Wo genau der ist, weiß man nach dem Konzert dann auch nicht mehr…

Und dann macht‘s mit einem mal Peng! – und es beginnt ein fruchtiges Klang-Chaos, das sich dann plötzlich zu einer Allianz zusammenschließt und vor Kraft strotzend in die sowieso schon heruntergefallenen Kinnladen des ebenfalls schweißnassen Publikums geschleudert wird. Punktgenau, wie ein gezielter Golfschlag ins Loch. Klingt übertrieben? Mag sein, aber wer das mitgemacht hat, weiß wovon hier die Rede ist!

Die Band vermag es, eine Art gesunden und lange vermissten Schmutz in die Jazzmusik zurückzuführen. Und das Publikum reibt sich gerne damit ein – und zwar von der Tschechischen Republik über Deutschland bis nach Spanien! Bandintern und für das zweite Album namensgebend, nennen die Sieben ihren Sound übrigens “JUNK”. Und ob man sich damit jetzt einreibt, es im Ganzen verschlingt oder sich mitten hineinwirft, ist einem selbst überlassen – ein Booster für das eingeschlafene Tanzbein ist es in jedem Fall!

El Khat, die in den Garagen und Lagerhallen von Jaffa gegründete und heute in Berlin ansässige Band, veröffentlicht nach ”Saadia Jefferson” (2019) und ”Albat Alawi Op.99” (2022) in diesem Jahr ihr drittes Album ”Mute”. Das Album täuscht über seinen Titel hinweg, denn es dringt mit rauer Intensität zu uns durch. Skitternde Trommeln und Bläser, eine zerklüftete Orgel, hypnotische jemenitische Melodien und einzigartige DIY-Perkussion- und Streichinstrumente verschmelzen zu einer ansteckenden, berauschenden Klangwelt. Mal wild und rau, mal üppig und einhüllend.

Die Idee zu El Khat hatte der Autodidakt und Multiinstrumentalist Eyal el Wahab. Aufgewachsen in der jüdisch-jemenitischen Diaspora von Tel Aviv, stieß er auf die Compilation “Qat, Coffee & Qambus: Raw 45s from Yemen”, schmiss daraufhin seinen Job als Cellist beim Jerusalem Andalusian Orchestra, lernte Arabisch, begann Instrumente aus Fundstücken zu bauen, wie sie in den 60er Jahren im Jemen gespielt wurden, und gründete El Khat. Seither arbeitet das Trio an einer Sammlung arabischer Melodien jemenitischen Ursprungs. Treibende Kraft dahinter ist der Wunsch nach kultureller Erkundung, gespeist aus der Migrationserfahrung der jemenitischen Juden und der Losgelöstheit von einem Land oder einer Flagge, wobei das Herz und das Erbe ihrer Musik im Jemen verwurzelt sind.

Ihr neues Album ”Mute” erforscht Distanz und Sprache - und deren Abwesenheit. Es handelt davon, aus einem Land vertrieben zu werden und im anderen nicht verstanden zu werden, stumm zu sein. In den Liedern, sagt el Wahab, geht es um „Beziehungen und den Kampf darum, zwei Seiten als ein Ganzes zu sehen, nicht als etwas, das mit Stumpfsinn und Konflikt endet.“  Klanglich ist es ein berauschender, retro-futuristischer Trip zu el Wahabs jemenitischen Wurzeln und zurück.

_______________________________

Starting in 2019, El Khat began to hone their sound in garages and warehouses. Through experimenting with DIY homemade instruments as a means to life minimalism philosophy it has led to the three-piece creating an endless collection of Arabic tunes of Yemeni origin.
Detached to a land or to any flag is the driving force behind the group, with the heart of their music and their heritage rooted in Yemen. The constant division that has been created by wars and immigrations have pushed out an identity. With 2 albums behind and a third to be released in 2024 El Khat is on a constant move sharing their art globally mainly in the US and the EU.
El Khat’s 3rd album mute belies its title as it careens out of the speakers with a raucous intensity. Formed in the garages and warehouses of Jaffa and now based in Berlin, the group’s ever- expanding vision makes a defiant stand against complacency, conflict and division. Skittering drums and brass, a jagged organ, hypnotic Yemeni melodies and one-of-a-kind DIY percussion and string instruments, all meld together into an infectious, heady soundscape.

Project Icarus wedges dark ambient themes into harsh noise and industrial ritualistic soundscapes.

The project is born from the mind of Giuseppe D'Addurno, Berlin-based italian multi-media artist, who creates alchemical performances and re-enacts magical rites on stage.

From his first experiences with death-metal bands, the musician has composed both music and lyrics that reflected a bleak vision of society.
In his dystopian vision, the suburbs of cities and the silent country-side lands are inherently imbibed with a quiet darkness, a silent unrest, a black tranquility.

On the other hand, Enrico Tiberi after studying Conservatorio in the center of Italy, his homeland, gets to sing, play guitar, piano, synths in several bands and projects (The Shell Collector, Resurrecturis, Tapewhore, Brain, Edenshade, Eyehate).

In the meanwhile sets up his own studio to work as a producer and mixing engineer, and studies with Tchad Blake (The Black Keys, Peter Gabriel, Arctic Monkeys, Pearl Jam), gets to work with artists from all over the world. (James Labrie from Dream Theater, Uli Kusch by Halloween among the others).

His passion for Telefon Tel Aviv, Aphex Twin, Amon Tobin, Björk and many more bring nrec's coming out to happen to the world of electronica. In 2015 his first EP ""Spaghettitronica"", very dark electro sounding. In 2016 his first LP ""Signals"", very highly reviewed and well acclaimed.

Starting at 19:00

Please come 10 minutes before the music performance starts to secure your place.

IMPORTANT! Members who have confirmed their attendance and do not show up will be removed indefinitely from the group.

Free entry. (Suggested donation for the house utilities 5-10€)

Limited capacity.

///////////

Das Projekt Icarus verbindet dunkle Ambient-Themen mit hartem Lärm und industriellen, rituellen Klanglandschaften.

Das Projekt entspringt dem Geist von Giuseppe D'Addurno, einem in Berlin lebenden italienischen Multimediakünstler, der alchemistische Performances kreiert und magische Riten auf der Bühne nachstellt.

Seit seinen ersten Erfahrungen mit Death-Metal-Bands hat der Musiker sowohl Musik als auch Texte komponiert, die eine düstere Vision der Gesellschaft widerspiegeln.

In seiner dystopischen Vision sind die Vororte der Städte und die stillen Landstriche von einer stillen Dunkelheit, einer stillen Unruhe und einer schwarzen Stille durchdrungen.

Auf der anderen Seite gibt es Enrico Tiberi, der nach seinem Studium am Conservatorio in seiner Heimat Italien singt, Gitarre, Klavier und Synthesizer in verschiedenen Bands und Projekten spielt (The Shell Collector, Resurrecturis, Tapewhore, Brain, Edenshade, Eyehate).

In der Zwischenzeit baut er sein eigenes Studio auf, um als Produzent und Mixing Engineer zu arbeiten, und studiert bei Tchad Blake (The Black Keys, Peter Gabriel, Arctic Monkeys, Pearl Jam), arbeitet mit Künstlern aus der ganzen Welt zusammen. (James Labrie von Dream Theater, Uli Kusch von Halloween u.a.).

Seine Leidenschaft für Telefon Tel Aviv, Aphex Twin, Amon Tobin, Björk und viele mehr bringen nrec's coming out to happen in die Welt der Electronica. 2015 erschien seine erste EP „Spaghettitronica“, ein sehr dunkler Elektro-Sound. Im Jahr 2016 seine erste LP „Signals“, sehr hoch bewertet und hoch gelobt.

Beginn um 19:00

Bitte kommt Ihr 10 Minuten vor Beginn der Musikperformance, um euch euren Platz zu sichern.

WICHTIG! Mitglieder, die ihre Teilnahme bestätigt haben und nicht auftauchen, werden auf unbestimmte Zeit aus der Gruppe ausgeschlossen.
